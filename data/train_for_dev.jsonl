{"text": "SA agri-tech startup Aerobotics raises further $2m funding.\n\nSouth African agri-tech startup Aerobotics has expanded its Series A funding round to US$4 million after securing an additional US$2 million from Paper Plane Ventures to assist its expansion efforts.\n\n\n\nFounded in Cape Town in 2014, Aerobotics uses aerial imagery from drones and satellites, and blends them with machine learning algorithms to provide early problem detection services to tree and wine farmers and optimise crop performance.\n\n\n\nThe startup’s cloud-based application Aeroview provides farmers with insights, scout mapping and other tools to mitigate damage to tree and vine crops from pest and disease.\n\n\n\nAerobotics, which launched a batch of new products late last year, secured US$2 million as part of its Series A round last July, and has now doubled that after raising funding from Paper Plane Ventures. The latest capital injection – announced at the launch of its new offices in the Waterkant area of Cape Town – takes the startup’s total raised funding to US$4.6 million after its first round in 2017, and will assist with its international expansion efforts.\n\n\n\n“We are proud to have made the announcement about expanding our Series A funding round to US$4 million at the launch of our new offices in Waterkant,” said Aerobotics co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) James Paterson. “We are grateful that Paper Plane Ventures has put their faith and capital in our company, which we will use to expand our growth in South Africa, the United States and around the world, and increase our ability of helping farmers and partners in the agriculture industry.”\n\n\n\nAerobotics also used the event to announce it is launching the first natural step to automated, accurate yield estimation with a new tool for farm yield management. Currently in development, the yield management tool that is being built within the Aeroview app allows farmers to select a yield sample within their orchard, capture fruit counts and fruit size and get a report on the size distribution and number of fruits.\n\n\n\nThis yield management tool helps farmers make informed decisions on how much fruit to thin during the early stages of the season to optimise their yield when it is time to harvest. The technology will be commercially available in the United States at the beginning of the 2019 growing season.\n\n\n\n“Farmers traditionally have faced challenges recording the data they capture in the field when scouting and analysing yield samples,” said Aerobotics head of product Nasreen Patel. “We believe this new field management technology that is being built right into Aeroview will empower farmers to collect more accurate data in-field and make more informed decisions on thinning their fruit and, ultimately, optimising their yield.”\n\n\n\nAerobotics also announced that Lindsay Griffin has joined the company as head of business enablement, focused on streamlining its corporate finance structure and enabling the business to scale efficiently at its current rapid pace. Meanwhile, two members of its executive team are moving to California to grow the company’s business development around the United States. Chief commercial officer Andrew Burdock and Chief platform officer Stuart van der Veen will be based in Los Angeles, where Aerobotics is set to launch its offices in the second quarter of 2019.\n\n\n\nAerobotics currently has two business development managers on the ground in the United States and is working with 10,000 acres of crops. The US-based staff is expected to grow to eight by the end of 2019 and will be based around the country where there are high concentrations of tree and vine crops.", "entities": [[0, 2, "headquarters_loc"], [21, 31, "org_in_focus"], [47, 50, "money_funded"], [61, 74, "headquarters_loc"], [93, 103, "org_in_focus"], [121, 129, "type_of_funding"], [147, 159, "cumulative"], [189, 201, "money_funded"], [207, 227, "investor"], [275, 284, "headquarters_loc"], [288, 292, "year_founded"], [294, 304, "org_in_focus"], [682, 692, "org_in_focus"], [757, 769, "money_funded"], [785, 793, "type_of_funding"], [800, 809, "date_of_funding"], [863, 883, "investor"], [1040, 1054, "cumulative"]]}

Seed Engine was one of the first ICT accelerators in this country, and this dynamic for-profit social enterprise is now supporting the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem from startup through to supplier,” said Faith Khanyile, chief executive officer (CEO) of WDB, a women-run investment firm which focuses on women-led businesses.\n\nCEO of Seed Engine and Seed Academy Donna Rachelson highlighted the role of entrepreneurs in job creation, and said the investments will help Seed Engine to support local entrepreneurs in growing businesses and job opportunities.\n\n“Incubation is not producing the results SA needs and entrepreneurs are battling to build and scale their businesses and create jobs. We take a fresh look at our entrepreneurial system and make quick, sustainable changes that result in jobs, wealth and certainty,” Rachelson said.\n\n“Through the WDB and Grovest we will be able to tap into corporate and government relationships and networks that will help Seed Engine reach deeper into the communities and sectors that need the most urgent support.”\n\nWDB also said it is likely its investment will increase to 51 per cent, as the partnership with Seed Engine serves both WDB’s business and social agendas.\n\n“We liked Seed Engine’s emphasis on black women and youth-owned businesses,” said Khanyile.\n\n“Many people in South Africa were not raised in an entrepreneurial environment in which they were encouraged to take an idea and grow a business. More than ever before, there is an urgency for young South Africans and female entrepreneurs in particular to be assisted in taking their ideas forward and build businesses.

The news comes just three months after its inaugural €6 million fundraise.\n\nDubbing itself a “mobile coaching cloud,” the startup democratises professional coaching, taking services usually reserved for top executives and making them available to employees at any level in the company. CoachHub’s AI-based matching system recommends three business coaches that fit the employee’s individual requirements and personal requests.\n\nThe platform boasts a global network of more than 400 certified coaches across six continents and over 30 languages. Coaches work remotely with employees at over 100 organisations, including large corporations like Generali and Bosch Rexroth, and household tech companies like SoundCloud and HelloFresh.\n\nSerial entrepreneurs and brothers Yannis and Matti Niebelschuetz founded the company in 2018, and have since built a team that’s currently 75 employees and forecasted to grow to 200 by mid-2020.\n\nYannis Niebelschuetz explained the company’s success: “Our customers are seeing measurable results in terms of increased rates of employee retention and happiness. Regular, tailored coaching sessions have been shown to have a positive impact on business and employee performance. However, the reliance of traditional formats on in-person coaching sessions, which is inflexible, time-consuming and unscalable, has kept coaching out of reach for all but the most senior staff. We are fundamentally disrupting the learning and development landscape and democratising access to business coaching.”\n\nThe funding will help the startup grow its pool of coaches in the UK, as well as its core markets in France, Germany, Benelux and the Nordics. In addition to the platform and business operation side of things, the funds will further develop the company’s Coaching Lab, a think tank for behavioural research in the coaching space, designed to support coach development.\n\nCommenting on the investment, David Kuczek of HV Holtzbrinck Ventures said: “Digital coaching has become a billion dollar market that’s increasing year on year, and we see CoachHub as the clear category leader in Europe.

He further added, “Overall, we think these kinds of recurring payments make up about 18 percent of total payment volume globally”.\n\nTakeuchi also stated, “We focus on what we think of as the recurring payments market — subscriptions, invoicing, installments — and each of those markets is super broken”.\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more updates in the tech startup world.\n\nDid you know you can post your job for free on our job board?

However, when pressed by Ventureburn, he admitted that it was “less than R1-million”.\n\nThe investment would allow for further development of his platform, which provides temporary positions such as waiters, models and promoters to events agencies. Sozala Media would also provide hands-on support to the platform’s clients, said Holdcroft.\n\nHe said he’d been speaking to Sozala Media for some time before he launched the platform, making it more what he called “an ongoing relationship” with the events company than a negotiation. None the less he said the deal was signed about three months ago, with the money landing in the startup’s account about six weeks ago.\n\nPeepz founder Nick Holdcroft when pressed admitted the investment from Sozala Media was less than R1-million\n\nHe added that he’d invested about R200 000 of his own money in the platform, money he’d drawn from cashing in his pension fund after leaving his former employer Distell, where he’d worked as a brand manager.\n\nHe said about 1800 candidates had registered on the platform so far, with about 125 agencies (of which 20 or 30, he added were frequent users) having signed up to tap staff, he said.\n\nHe described the platform as “kind of like an Uber or Airbnb system” which aims to solve problems such as staff not pitching up on time to events or arriving with the incorrect clothing because they weren’t briefed properly.\n\nTo solve this the platform allows potential staffing candidates to engage with events companies to iron out any specific requirements and expectations for their respective jobs.\n\nIn addition, the platform uses each candidate’s geolocation to ensure that only those with a certain radius of an event are picked to apply for any positions. Holdcroft said this would help prevent staff arriving late at events because they weren’t able to access transport or because they were stuck in traffic.\n\nPeepz charges events companies a placement fee on any successful hires. This he said is usually about 15% of a candidate’s pay, but discounted rates are offered for high volume transactions.\n\nIt’s small beginnings still for Holdcroft, as he’s currently the startup’s only employee and outsources all web development work to a team of three developers in Cape Town.\n\nTo grow his platform Holdcroft might now have to invest in some staffing of his own.\n\nFeatured image: Waiter at VC4A’s Africa Early Stage Investor Summit 2018 held in Cape Town in November last year (Supplied)", "entities": []}

{"text": "World's First 3D-Printed Car Takes Inaugural Drive.\n\nLocal Motors gets behind the wheel for historic ride in Chicago at IMTS – International Manufacturing Technology Show\n\nCHICAGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–September 23, 2014–\n\nAfter a grueling six-day week that included nearly round-the-clock work, Local Motors, together with Cincinnati Incorporated, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and AMT – The Association For Manufacturing Technology, unveiled the world’s first 3D-printed, drivable vehicle. Called the Strati, the car took a victory lap around McCormick Place early on Saturday, September 13, 2014 with Local Motors CEO John B. Rogers, Jr., at the helm, accompanied by Doug Woods, president of AMT.\n\nMeet the Strati, the world’s first 3D-printed car. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nThe Strati was built in three phases during the six-day show. In phase one the car was 3D-printed on a Cincinnati Incorporated BAAM (Big Area Additive Manufacturing Machine) over 44 hours using cutting edge technology called additive manufacturing. Phase two, known as subtractive manufacturing, included one day of milling on a machine provided by Thermwood. Once complete, the third and final phase was rapid assembly, in which a team led by Local Motors put the finishing touches on the world’s first 3D-printed car. Then, the key was turned and the vehicle set off on its maiden voyage, marking an important moment in history.\n\n“At Local Motors, we are changing the way people move,” said John B. Rogers, Jr., CEO and co-founder of Local Motors. “Using 3D printing, we have reimagined how cars are created using modern manufacturing techniques. The results are astounding. We have reduced the amount of car parts from 25,000 to less than 50, proving that we can take a car from designed to driven in less than six months. That is the game changer in the automotive world.”\n\nA team of industry experts came together to build the Strati, including SABIC Innovative Plastics, who provided the carbon reinforced ABS Plastic used to 3D print some of the first iterations of the car. Renault donated the powertrain from the Twizy. Siemens provided the Solid Edge® software for the structural design elements and Fifteen52 built custom wheels to match the design.\n\nSolid Edge was integral in preparing the Strati for 3D printing. The mechanical component parts for the Strati were leveraged from the Renault Twizy. As the design files were not initially integrated with the design of the 3D printed portion of the car, virtually all of the components had to be to fit onto the new “chassis.” Alex Fiechter, Head of Innovation at Local Motors, explained how Solid Edge provided the answer, “by enabling us to easily import and modify the component parts to design our own intermediate structures that would reliably mount to the ABS/Carbon material extruded by the 3D printer.”\n\nAbout Local Motors\n\nFrom bytes-to-bits, the Local Motors platform empowers anyone to design, build and sell the world’s coolest machines.

The fund, established in 2012, invested approximately $81.5 million in five companies. NCOF II generated a gross internal rate of return of about 24 percent and a multiple of invested capital of about 1.5x with its close. Crown was the fund’s manager, holding a 53.6 percent interest.

(“Crown” or the “Corporation”) (TSX: CRWN), which provides growth capital to successful mid-market companies, today announced that Norrep Credit Opportunities Fund II, LP and Norrep Credit Opportunities Fund II (Parallel), LP (collectively, “NCOF II”) have been closed following the recent repayment of the special situations loan to CRH Medical Corporation, which represented the final remaining investment in NCOF II. Crown was the manager of NCOF II and held a 53.6% interest in aggregate.\n\nNCOF II was established in 2012, closed its first loan in December 2012 and invested approximately $81.5 million in five companies: Genalta Power Inc., Claude Resources Inc., Questrade Inc., CRH Medical Corporation, and Corrosion Service Company. NCOF II generated a gross IRR of approximately 24% and a multiple of approximately 1.5X(1).\n\n“The loans in this portfolio performed well for our investors, adding to Crown’s outstanding 17-year track record in mid-market lending,” said Chris Johnson, President and CEO of Crown. “There is a significant unmet need for customized financing solutions aimed at the mid-market, and we are building on our track record to expand Crown’s presence and asset base, both directly and through our fund management business.”\n\nThe completion of NCOF II has triggered payment of $4.3 million of performance fees to Crown, as manager of NCOF II. Prior to the closing of its initial public offering (“IPO”), Crown committed to pay 100% of the performance fee distributions accrued to June 30, 2015 to the Pre-IPO plan participants. In addition, Crown’s current compensation policy provides that 50% of such performance fee distributions earned will be distributed to the employees. As such, Crown has retained approximately $1.0 million of the performance fees.\n\nCrown’s current special situations fund, Crown Capital Fund IV, LP, has deployed approximately $170 million of the targeted $300 million.\n\nABOUT CROWN\n\nCrown (TSX: CRWN) is a specialty finance company focused on providing capital to successful Canadian and select U.S. companies that are unwilling or unable to obtain suitable financing from traditional capital providers such as banks and private equity funds. Crown also manages capital pools, including some in which Crown has a direct ownership interest. Crown originates, structures and provides tailored special situation and long-term financing solutions to a diversified group of private and public mid-market companies in the form of loans, royalties and other structures with minimal or no ownership dilution.\n\n(1)\n\n“Gross IRR” means the gross internal rate of return generated from an investment before consideration of management fees and expenses and is calculated based on an investment’s realized amounts and unrealized amounts (cash distributions) and actual cash outflows made in respect of an investment, with timing based on when such distributions occurred or are likely to occur. It is then calculated by determining the discount rate that will bring all cash distributions (realized and unrealized) to a net present value of zero.\n\n“Multiple” is calculated as total combined proceeds divided by the aggregate investment amount\n\nFor further information: Craig Armitage, Investor Relations, craig.armitage@crowncapital.ca, (416) 347-8954\n\nPhoto courtesy of Crown Capital Partners", "entities": []}

The latest round, led by investor Jake Silverstein, will be used to expand Fitwall’s growing footprint and further its development of in-studio and at-home fitness offerings.\n\n“Fitwall’s goal is to provide the best fitness experience in the world by empowering people to succeed like never before in a fun, engaging and effective way,” said Josh Weinstein, Fitwall’s chief executive officer and founding board member. “This capital will help us to expand quickly and strategically into new markets, innovate rapidly, and deliver on our vision around the world.”\n\nSilverstein, a private investor based in Florida, is the founder of E’lir Capital, an investment company focused on early-stage technology and consumer companies. Previously, he was an early employee of Prodea Systems, a connected-home technology company founded by telecommunications pioneers Hamid and Anousheh Ansari, the first female space tourist and the first Iranian in space.\n\nSilverstein holds a master’s degree from the University of Michigan, and received his bachelor’s degree in mathematics at age 19.

Every second of the training session is monitored and members track progress with FIT Factor (Fitwall Intensity Training Factor), Fitwall’s proprietary metric.\n\nEach workout incorporates a series of moves like pull-ups, kicks and squats by stepping, pulling and jumping on rungs. Interspersed throughout are planks, rows and groundwork done with weighted resistance bungees attached to the Fitwall.

{"text": "Flipkart To Make Another Bet On Customer Loyalty Programme.\n\nLoyalty Programme For Customers Who Hit A Certain Threshold Of Purchases; Flipkart To Spend $173 Mn In Three Years On This Plan\n\nIndian ecommerce company Flipkart is ready to make another bet on its customer loyalty programme, but in a unique way. Rather than charging an upfront fee for the membership, the Flipkart customer loyalty programme will be activated once a customer hits a certain threshold of purchases.\n\nAccording to reports, the company has set aside $173 Mn (INR 1,178 Cr) for expenditure on services under the programme for the next three years. The scheme is expected to be launched by the end of July.\n\nBeing tagged ‘Lock-In’, the programme is expected to offer Flipkart’s “loyal customers” faster and free deliveries, early access to deals, and other privileges across its group companies, including Phone-Pe and Myntra.\n\nEarlier, in 2014, Flipkart had launched and then rolled back its loyalty programme due to lukewarm response, while its arch-rival Amazon continued to increase the customer base of its subscription-based Prime service, which offers fast and one-day delivery, among other benefits.\n\nThe report cited an anonymous Flipkart employee as stating: “The idea is to start treating the cohort of loyal customers as more special. This is why it will be based on frequency and repeat purchases rather than a fixed fee paid upfront.”\n\nThe Flipkart Lock-In programme has been brewing for a year, as a loyalty team was constituted around July 2017.\n\nThe ‘Festive Pass’, which was launched during the company’s annual flagship sale in September 2017 was a testing phase of this loyalty programme to understand the market before full-fledged launch of the service.\n\nFlipkart had tied up with MakeMyTrip, Gaana, Uber, and Hotstar for ‘festive pass’ and these tieups are expected to be a part of the loyalty programme too.\n\nFlipkart: Increasing Focus On Customers\n\nAfter the Walmart deal, Flipkart continues to expand its product portfolio, commitments, and plans for new ventures. Earlier, the company asked its employees to continue delivering after the acquisition.\n\nInc42 had earlier reported that Flipkart’s grocery operations would start in Hyderabad, followed by Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, and Pune.\n\nFlipkart had plans to explore the ‘fresh’ category of fruits and vegetables in Bengaluru, where it launched grocery services last year.\n\nIt also plans to offer steep price cuts on groceries at the beginning and end of each month, similar to the offers made by Amazon India and BigBasket, with discounts of 25-50% on groceries.\n\nPrior to this, CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy had announced that the company will include “gemstone” and “jewellery” as the focused categories for 2019.\n\nIn FY 2017-18, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Flipkart was $7.5 Bn and net sales of $4.6 Bn, representing more than 50% growth year-over-year in both cases, according to the numbers shared by Walmart. This has come on the back of growth in categories like fashion, mobile phones and large appliances.\n\nAlso, Flipkart announced the launch of a durability certification called FurniSure. With this move, the ecommerce makes furniture certified by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) available to both online and offline shoppers.\n\nEmphasising on quality control further, the company had introduced checks and balances for its sellers to audit product quality so that it can reduce its return rate from customers due to poor quality products.\n\nFlipkart sent an email to its sellers stating that if they fail to pass the audit, they could be delisted or they might even lose the ‘Flipkart Assured’ badge on the platform.\n\nWhile the ecommerce major addresses Competition Commission of India and Income Tax authorities over Walmart acquisition, the continuous complaints by traders’ and sellers’ body haven’t been able to divert the company’s attention away from its customers.\n\n[The development was reported by ET.]", "entities": []}
{"text": "Dutchman Marc van der Chijs takes Hut 8 to IPO in Canada.\n\nHut 8, a cryptocurrency mining company founded by Dutch venture capitalist Marc van der Chijs got listed on the Canadian TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) via a reverse listing. The crypto mining company is partly owned by chip maker Bitfury Group, one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the Blockchain ecosystem and a maker of ASIC silicon chips, printed circuit boards (PCB), servers, and data centers. Hut 8 previously raised €81.2M ($100M) from private investors before being listed on TSXV.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nDutchman’s Crypto Startups\n\nMarc’s other notable investments and companies in the space include First Block Capital, a Blockchain VC firm and ICO (Initial Coin Offerings) bank FirstCoin.com. Marc’s realization about the need to have an alternative money system came as a jolt when he lost money during Cyprus Banking Crisis.\n\n“After moving to Canada the Cyprus banking crisis started and I happened to be involved in a company there which bank account got frozen. That led me to do research on how the global financial system really works because I did not understand how a bank can stop you from taking your own money out of your account. I quickly learned that money in a bank account is actually not your money, but that it’s an asset of the bank. I started looking for alternatives and then came across Bitcoin in early 2013,” said Marc in an interview with Gene Swank. “Today’s listing on the TSXV is a milestone for Canadian investors, who can now access one of the world’s largest publicly traded crypto-mines without purchasing the underlying cryptocurrency. In crypto-mining, the scale is what determines success in the short term, but is also what allows mines to weather any volatility over the long term. Our exclusive partnership with Bitfury, one of the world’s leading full-service Blockchain companies, facilitates the kind of scale that will allow us to deliver ongoing value to investors,” said Sean Clark, interim CEO of Hut 8 and founder and CEO of First Block Capital that Marc co-founded with Sean.\n\nDriving other miners out of competition\n\nIt appears that Marc van and Sean Clark adhere to Peter Theil, PayPal co-founder and a billionaire entrepreneur, and investor. Thiel professed the idea that “competition is for losers“, and that competition reduces the profits and startups should try to avoid competing and instead try to create their ‘secret’ success formula, be it a network, technology or distribution strategy. Marc and Sean newly listed company have also adopted a similar strategy of making the competition irrelevant as echoed by interim CEO Sean in his interview with Bloomberg.\n\n“We benefit because we gain market share because then the hobbyist who’s mining for 10 cents a kilowatt-hour is going to leave the market because their break-even point is much much higher,” he said. “Because we’re an industrial data center scale play, we can actually go below $1,000 for a while and everyone will leave and we’ll gain market share,” said Sean.\n\nInnovation alone is not enough: A lesson for startups\n\nOne of the core lessons Dutch and other regional startups can learn from Marc is his ability to execute faster and more aggressively than others in the industry. The billionaire investor acknowledged his strength when asked if he’s got really innovative startups or he attributes the success to anything else.\n\n“I don’t have a most innovative project, but I would say that the ‘reverse take-over’ structure that we use to quickly raise lots of capital for blockchain companies is the biggest innovation we bring to the sector. What this means is that we start a company, capitalize it ourselves, grow it as fast as possible and then take it public by merging it with a listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange. That has allowed us to become the leaders in this space, simply because we could raise capital extremely fast,” said Marc.\n\nHis startup Hut 8 was quick to team up with Bitfury in December last year when both of the companies announced that Bitfury will provide Hut 8 with a mix of hardware, software, installation and operational services to help the latter build the largest North American datacenter for mining cryptocurrencies. This helped Hut 8 later in pitching the idea of reverse IPO whereby Bitfury is already the biggest shareholder of Hut 8.", "entities": []}

{"text": "SEC ban puts brakes on equity crowdfunding in Nigeria.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria’s ban on equity crowdfunding “is seriously slowing down” the introduction of crowdfunding in the country, says a new report.\n\nThe Crowdfunding Potential for Nigeria report released last month by the Crowdfunding Hub, says crowdfunding has significant potential in the country, but that the SEC’s ban issued in August last year has stifled the setting up of crowdfunding platforms.\n\nThe SEC believes that crowdfunding cannot be effective in Nigeria for now because of a lack of rules. Donation and reward-based crowdfunding are however excluded from the SEC’s regulatory remit.\n\nThis is despite a fast-evolving banking system which provides a promising infrastructure for crowdfunding in Nigeria, as well as a burgeoning entrepreneurial scene and a fast-growing population of 179 million.\n\n‘Donation and reward-based crowdfunding should be fostered as a first step’\n\n“To move forward, donation and reward-based crowdfunding should be fostered as a first step towards crowdfund investing,” says the report’s author Suzanne Wisse-Huiskes of MatchBox Consultancy.\n\nWisse-Huiskes, who lived and worked in Nigeria between 2014 and 2016, consulted with over 30 policy makers, NGOs, investors, and entrepreneurs in compiling the report.\n\nShe pointed out in the report that these types of crowdfunding have successfully paved the way for equity crowdfunding in other regions. The report says the African continent accounted for about $83.2-million in crowdfunding in 2015, with Nigeria accounting for between seven and eight million dollars of this.\n\nAt the start of this year Nigeria had one equity based platform, Malaik, launched in 2015. The landing page on its website asks those interested to leave their details to join a waiting list for the relaunch of the site.\n\nIn addition as the beginning of this year Nigeria had three donations-based platforms, namely: Donate-ng.com, Naturad and Imeela.\n\nThe report notes that the lack of patent laws is another concern. It discourages entrepreneurs to share their business ideas online.\n\nWisse-Huiskes told Ventureburn that “to my knowledge, peer-to-peer lending platforms are also illegal”.\n\n‘The SEC is looking at the crowdfunding rules in US and Canada’\n\n“The legal provisions of crowdfunding are a big challenge to the organisation (SEC). However, they are looking for ways to go about it so that companies will enjoy the benefits of crowdfunding in the country as well,” says Wisse-Huiskes, who adds that the SEC is looking at the crowdfunding rules in US and Canada in order to ensure an enabling legal and regulatory framework.\n\nShe said equity crowdfunding could prove to be an expedient way for many struggling entrepreneurs to raise capital, since they are considered as high risk to banks.\n\nDerin Fagbure, a director of donations-based platform FundMyP, agreed, saying crowdfunding can help thousands of Nigerian business owners to access finance.\n\nShe said business owners often battle to obtain finance from banks which are reluctant to advance small loans which they view as more likely to be defaulted upon. Those that approach the government for funding often have to battle bureaucratic procedures, she added.\n\nHowever Fagbure said scams on donation-based platforms are common, meaning crowdfunding platforms often have to battle to win the trust of the public by making them more aware of what crowdfunding platforms do.\n\nAttempts to get comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission by time of publication proved unsuccessful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "#Startupfest Chats: Crew knows what real traction is after $10M round.\n\nMontreal’s International Startup Festival was a week of sun, fun, and compelling conversation. Here’s one of the great startup chats we had à Le Jardin des Écluses.\n\n\n\nMontreal-based curated design and development marketplace Crew got its summer started right with a $10 million Series A round, led by Accomplice, with participation from Real Ventures, iNovia, BDC Capital, and others. The FounderFuel alumnus was on hand at #Startupfest as the round was closing, so we sat down with Crew co-founder Luke Chesser about scaling curation, and understanding what successful entrepreneurs mean when they talk about traction.\n\nSo you’re from Vancouver, but you’re now here permanently in Montreal. How did that happen?\n\nI originally came up to Montreal when I was 17 to go to McGill University for engineering. And I was doing engineering – civil engineering – and it wasn’t what I thought it was going to be. It was missing the creative aspect of engineering that I was really interested in.\n\nIn my last year at McGill I hooked up with the three other co-founders of Crew – Mikael, Stephanie, and Angus – they were working on this company called Ooomf, which had just gone through FounderFuel. I joined them right after they raised the first half a million dollars, and basically from there we did the usual startup thing and pivoted maybe three or four months after I started.\n\nAnd the ‘usual startup thing’ in this case is basically figuring out what to do?\n\nYeah, we were basically looking for product-market fit. We were working on a mobile landing page for apps, and while we were working on it we weren’t getting a lot of traction. It’s hard to know at the time what traction looks like because you’ve never done this before, but when we pivoted to the idea of building a marketplace for mobile and web talent, what we realized is that we hadn’t seen traction before like what we’ve seen now.\n\nIn our first month we did about $100,000 in projects and just from there it took off. In our first year, we saw our average project size continually creep up to the point where it was $5,000, and in our first six months I think we did $1,000,000 in projects. Since then, in the last year and a half, we’ve done over $15,000,000 USD in projects, and the average project size is around $10,000.\n\nSo let’s talk a bit about the platform, because there has been an explosion in the last couple of years of marketplaces that connect talent to clients. But you guys are taking a more curated approach.\n\nI think most people are aware that there are marketplaces online, and have been for a little while, that will connect you designers, developers, maids, whatever it is. And they all go on the lowest price point model, based upon the way that they’ve set up the marketplace and the interactions between the people posting the projects and the talent that’s on there.\n\n“It’s hard to know at the time what traction looks like because you’ve never done this before.”\n\nAnd what you see is that quality doesn’t always win, it’s basically a competition on price. The work suffers, and the people that work on the projects aren’t happy because they’re always competing on price.\n\nSo what we’ve done is flipped it, and said from the beginning we’d curate both sides. What that means is to be part of the platform, a designer or a developer is vetted by our team. What we look at is past projects they’ve worked on, past experiences, how they interact with clients and how they communicate. And while they’re working on a project we’re constantly looking at how they interact with clients on Crew, to make sure we’re constantly vetting.\n\nOn the flip side, we work with project owners to help them make the best decisions possible for their budget – like maybe choosing a landing page over a full site. Basically what we’re trying to do is provide some kind of value even if we can’t match them with someone in their price range.\n\nSo you’re basically Match.com’ing a whole industry vertical.\n\nBasically, yeah.\n\nWe were talking about traction before, but how do you scale that? I’m assuming it was a lot of work and trust building on both sides.\n\nThere’s kind of a couple of ways that we’re scaling it. The first is that our support team and project management staff is incredible, and as we’ve scaled we’ve worked on tools to quickly figure out whether or not a project is going to be a good fit for Crew. So that’s been a lot of work on the back end for our developers.\n\nOn the other side, what we’re trying to do is educate people before they come onto the platform. So that means we’ve put up tools like how much to make an app, which blew up actually on the Internet.\n\nOk, now a $10 million round, bringing you to I think 13-14 million total raised to date. What’s the next step?\n\nThe first thing is definitely continuing to build the team. To give you an idea, at this time last year we were probably five or six people working on Crew, and now we’re about 24 people. So our biggest challenge over the last year has been growing the team and making sure the people on it are excited and talented. We’re going to try and double that team size, but do it without losing the quality of the team.\n\nAt the same time, we’re going to be doubling down on our marketing efforts. We do a lot of stuff to built trust and provide information outside of the platform, to help bring people onto the platform. Because it’s a high barrier for you to get onto the platform and post a project – that’s a pretty big commitment and trust. And what we found was building tools outside of the platform that people could use for free, they saw the level of work we did, and the level of commitment to quality, and that builds trust when they are ready to build something.", "entities": [[20, 24, "org_in_focus"], [59, 63, "money_funded"], [240, 248, "headquarters_loc"], [298, 302, "org_in_focus"], [339, 350, "money_funded"], [351, 359, "type_of_funding"], [374, 384, "investor"], [410, 423, "investor"], [425, 431, "investor"], [433, 444, "investor"]]}

Each box includes three pieces of clothing for 30 days, free shipping both ways, and free dry cleaning and laundry services. The company was launched in March by Pigeon and CMO Laura Bryce, with a goal of helping people who have thousands of items of clothing, yet still, find themselves with “nothing to wear.”\n\nThe company was born out of the co-founders realizing they were spending upwards of $4,000 a year on clothing, despite having 400 different items. Dresst aims to allow users to wear 120 new pieces across more than three years. The company offers a selection of items from upscale designers with an average retail price between $200 and $300 per item, valuing the monthly price of rented clothes at between $700 and $900, with Dresst setting its price per box at $99. The e-commerce startup’s platform is powered by Shopify, which recently introduced a host of new features at its 2019 Shopify Unite conference in Toronto.\n\nRELATED: Shopify reports $320.5 million revenue in first quarter of 2019\n\n“Investing to drive awareness… is critical since we’re creating an entirely new shopping behaviour in the Canadian market,” Pigeon said. “Enhancing our online experience is key to our success. We are creating the ultimate shopping experience for women and this will be done through personalization and customization. We’ll be leveraging our data to deliver highly personalized style recommendations to each and every customer.”\n\nThe funds will be used to build out Dresst’s virtual closet with more variety, drive customer acquisition, and enhance the online customer experience. The platform currently has about 100 styles and Pigeon said it is adding 20 to 25 new pieces every month. It will also be launching a popup in Toronto’s Stakt market August 13 to 19.\n\nImage courtesy Dresst", "entities": [[0, 7, "headquarters_loc"], [35, 41, "org_in_focus"], [49, 57, "money_funded"], [60, 66, "org_in_focus"], [160, 168, "money_funded"], [169, 173, "type_of_funding"], [221, 234, "cumulative"]]}

{"text": "Meet Google's fierce new enemy in Europe: GRIP.\n\nToday sees the launch of - cue the 'get a grip' jokes - GRIP, which is short for 'Google Redress & Integrity Platform'. No, it's not another Google service or a Google+ replacement, but rather a platform that caters to the American online search and advertising giant's European adversaries.\n\nTo wit, the platform aims to - and I quote - \"offer victims of Google’s anti-competitive business practices in Europe a mechanism to evaluate their potential claims\".\n\nGRIP, which is being presented this morning at a press conference in Brussels, is positioned not an industry lobby, but \"a platform providing information, representation and legal services\".\n\nBehind GRIP are Hausfeld & Co, a well-known international law firm that specialises in competition litigation, and niche public affairs consultancy agency Avisa. The former already represents British vertical search tech company Foundem, the original complainant in the EC’s Google investigation (see below), in its damages action in the UK High Court, while the latter is 'assisting' another crucial complainant in the case, namely French Internet search firm 1plusV.\n\nHausfeld and Avisa say GRIP’s two main goals are 1) to \"seek redress for those who have suffered harm\" from any of Google services, be it Search, Android, YouTube, Shopping, Maps or something else, and 2) to \"ensure search neutrality\" (although it fails to provide a definition for that).\n\nThe GRIP platform thus builds on the European Commission’s Statement of Objections dating back to April 15, 2015 which outlines the EC's position in assessing the viability of their claims against Google.\n\n\"It's time to start building civil cases,\" Europe-based Hausfeld partner Laurent Geelhand told The New York Times, threateningly.\n\nIndeed, Google already faces antitrust charges from Europe’s competition authorities, which just last week it vehemently denied in a bulky report, claiming that there was significant competition in the bloc's online search market and that the company’s services actually increased choice for local consumers.\n\nThe European Commission has been investigating Google in relation to the way it displays search results since 2010, which may ultimately lead to huge fines for the Internet giant.\n\nIn addition, major European publishers are heavily lobbying European antitrust officials about the 'Google problem', The New York Times reported last week.\n\nAnd now GRIP may lead to a number of civil cases across Europe from companies seeking damages from Google, although their outcome is quite unpredictable.\n\nTo join GRIP, the companies behind the platform says Google rivals can fill in an online form but need \"a concrete, solid case\" against the company, and that entry fees - do not include any potential litigation costs - will be based on their annual revenues (see below).\n\nAccording to a GRIP press release (PDF), a number of claims have already been brought in different jurisdictions across Europe, while \"further litigation is expected in the years to come\".\n\nThe vehicle is open to individuals, although GRIP more likely caters to businesses and associations.\n\nIn the aforementioned press release, Geelhand comments:\n\n\"Rival online services were denied a fair display in search results because of Google’s practices. Google was also able to generate additional profit, often at the consumers’ expense. Any person or entity that engaged in e-commerce in the EU may have a civil claim and through GRIP.”\n\nAvisa Partners founder Jacques Lafitte appears even more abrasive:\n\n“It has been five years between the first complaint against Google and the EC’s statement of objections, which is about three times longer than the groundbreaking Microsoft case. Google’s President, lawyers and publicists have worked well to create this delay.\"\n\n\"But Google has not been able to stop the inevitable: it finally faces justice,” he concludes.\n\nAlso read:\n\nUnder pressure, Google moves to consolidate its European operations and hands the reins to Matt Brittin\n\nGoogle starts axing search results in Europe under ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling", "entities": []}

This included mentorship, monthly expert-led sessions, exclusive office space in Sandton, marketing, legal and other business support services as well as access to the broader RMI network (see this story).\n\nAlphaCode said at the demo day, half of the startups in the cohort had “positively pivoted” their initial offerings after applying principles learnt and guidance from their mentors.\n\nThe eight pitched in front of a panel that included AlphaCode Incubate senior mentor Tanye ver Loren van Themaat, Investment Banking at BofA Securities managing director Anthony Knox, Royal Bafokeng Holdings investment manager Katlego Kobue and RMI junior investment executive Nimalan Reddy.\n\n‘Scalable, defensible business model’\n\nAlphaCode said the panel described Jamii Cities as having a scalable and defensible business model which could grow exponentially over the next few years.\n\nTaylor (picture above, left with Maadsorp), who contemplated doing an MBA before joining the programme, said he’d gained “much more” through the experience.\n\n“I have built a network, got great advice, was pushed hard to do better and had my ideas challenged to produce the best results.

Through access to open standards, best practices, IBM tools, and course materials, the broad scope of this initiative will enable vital skills development,” says Hamilton Ratshefola, country general manager for IBM South Africa.\n\n“In order to find solutions to Africa’s challenges, industries across the spectrum need to enable the existing and future workforce to perform at the forefront of technologies such as cognitive and cloud computing.

{"text": "‘Asaan Hai Badalna’- Quikr Proves It With Its New Office Campus In Bangalore.\n\n????????????????????????????????????\n\nIts name is Quikr and it moves fast! Staying true to its value, online classified platform, Quikr, moved into its new swanky office in Hebbal, Bangalore in just a matter of four months, since work started on the new building.\n\nLeaving the ramparts of Mumbai, Quikr zeroed in on an old garment factory in Bangalore as an ideal choice. And why was that so? It was the high ceilings and the big windows which create a sense of open space that caught the attention of this unicorn! While the external structures have largely remained the same, several walls have been knocked down on the inside in keeping with its emphasis on transparency. In the same vein, all the conference rooms are also glass panelled.\n\nThe video below illustrates the building’s transformation from a garment factory to Quikr’s workshop!\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMtivg46GeI]\n\nPerhaps the most interesting feature in the main building is the upper deck which is actually a machan or a deck like space that can be used as a meeting space. The deck resembling a DJ’s booth, offers the best view of the main building including the logo painted in the atrium- a giant Q on the main floor that invokes a sense of pride and symbolically ties everything together.\n\nAs far as the money spent on the new office, CEO Pranay Chulet’s reply was simple, “Much less than what you think.”\n\nThe new four acre campus house five buildings out of which two are currently operational with seating capacity of more than 1,200 people. Dotted with a lot of green patches, the campus has an open cafeteria, with a new recreation centre to follow soon in one of the buildings. The campus took about 3-4 months to get ready and it has become operational in phases since Quikr shifted base from Mumbai to Bangalore in search of talent.\n\nSpeaking to Inc42 earlier, Pranay had stated that it was a tough thing for them to go through so much change, but he added it was the right thing to do as in Mumbai, they would not have been able to grow that fast.\n\nHe adds, “We have been rolling on the winds of change for a while now and it’s great that we have space brimming with energy as our Bangalore HQ. ‘Asaan Hai Badalna’ is not just a brand tagline for us but an embodied belief. We believe change is good and easy.”\n\nOne could not agree more. From the start of its entrepreneurial journey in 2008 to a valuation of more than $1 Bn, the startup has grown at an energetic pace. Today, it is one of the leading cross-category classified platforms in India, with 30 Mn unique users a month. With the launch of Quikr Services last month, it will now take a shot at cracking the $100 Bn home services market in India.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Google leads €6.2M Series A funding for TypingDNA, which authenticates people based on their typing behaviour.\n\nAuthentication and making sure that an intended user gets access to a particular system is of utmost importance. For as long as we can recall, the most standard method of authentication has been entering a username and password but we all know that this method is not fool proof and can be hacked into or leaked. While there are newer ways to authenticate a user, most of them require some sort of additional provisions. For example, one can use their smartphone, while logging into Facebook on a PC.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nA Bucharest-based startup TypingDNA has come up with an innovative solution for simplifying authentication. The company offers an Application Programmable Interface or an API that can be integrated by developers and is touted to enable ‘frictionless authentication’ based on the way one types. This solution offered by the company caught the eye of Google’s AI-focused venture fund, Gradient Ventures, who led the Series A round of funding for the startup.\n\nSeries A round for improving adoption of typing biometrics worldwide\n\nAs mentioned earlier, TypingDNA recently conducted its Series A round of funding wherein it raised €6.2 million. The latest round of funding was led by Gradient Ventures, which is Google’s AI-focused venture fund, and EU-based fund GapMinder, Techstars Ventures and other prior investors joined in as well. The company plans to utilise freshly raised investment to offer more tools that will enable integration of their API with existing website development platforms and expand its developer support network.\n\n“Advancing the research and distribution of typing biometrics is of global importance. Keyboards are incorporated in almost any device today, making typing behavior the most widely available user biometric. This round of funding will allow us to further our mission to provide user-friendly, non-intrusive biometrics and increased security to people around the world,” said Raul Popa, CEO and Co-founder at TypingDNA.\n\nUnravelling TypingDNA’s typing authentication\n\nRecognising people based on the way they type is no easy feat as TypingDNA takes stock of keystroke dynamics statistics about a user’s key presses, and turns them into typing patterns. The company’s API engine then kicks in to analyse and match the recoded typing patterns against previously recorded patterns by users, and this type of authentication is called typing biometrics. While this is not a new technology, it was never really super accurate and reliable. However, TypingDNA claims that its solution has an accuracy rate of between 99 and 99.9 percent.\n\nTypingDNA is a typing authentication that is currently ACE compliant for verifying students online. Additionally, European Banking Authority considers typing biometrics to be compliant for SCA regulation (2FA in banking and payments in EU). It should also be noted that TypingDNA’s authentication API is open source and accepts user keystrokes in a standardized manner to enable easy integration into any desktop or mobile application.\n\nAs per the company, developers can integrate TypingDNA’s API as a passive two-factor authentication option, password recovery method, or just use it to ensure inputs are matched for a given user. TypingDNA also recently announced that its mobile developer SDK now supports the latest version of iOS and Android applications.\n\nImage Credits: TypingDNA\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more European technology news.", "entities": [[0, 6, "investor"], [13, 18, "money_funded"], [19, 27, "type_of_funding"], [40, 49, "org_in_focus"], [773, 782, "headquarters_loc"], [797, 806, "org_in_focus"], [1154, 1171, "investor"], [1185, 1193, "type_of_funding"], [1321, 1330, "org_in_focus"], [1398, 1410, "money_funded"], [1451, 1468, "investor"], [1531, 1540, "investor"], [1542, 1560, "investor"]]}

{"text": "DHL India To Invest $100 Mn To Expand Warehouse Capacity.\n\nLogistics giant Deutsche Post DHL Group is planning to expand its warehouse capacity in India. The move may have been triggered by DHL India looking at the new planned national tax system and increasing ecommerce transactions.\n\nVikas Anand, Managing Director at DHL Supply Chain India said, “We see business-to-consumer as the next big challenge, a big growth area and we really want to tap into that through businesses such as modern retail.”\n\nApart from increasing its warehouse space, DHL Supply Chain India is also looking to strengthen its transportation network which is used to deliver products from businesses to industrial and retail customers. Currently, the company transports goods by road, mainly through contracted trucks from dedicated vendors. It is looking to use railroads to improve time and fuel cost efficiency.\n\nAs per a report released by the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry-Confederation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, (FICCI- CMSME), the B2C ecommerce market in India is expected to store a potential of $26 Bn. The study also estimates that $2 Bn in revenues can be achieved by 2020.\n\nRelated Article: DHL Ecommerce To Start Direct Logistics Operations In India With BlueDart\n\nDHL India plans to invest more than $100 Mn in an additional capacity over the next three to four years. Out of this, about 65% will go into warehousing. The company aims to increase the warehouse space to more than 10 Mn square feet by 2020. Currently, it has warehouse space of 7 Mn sq ft. Multi-client centres located near metropolitan cities will make up 70% of the total space. The remaining space will be spread across various cities and towns that would be closer to the end-users.\n\nAccording to Anand, DHL Supply Chain India’s sales have grown at about 30% annually over the past five years. This is double the estimate of the contract logistics industry average. The company claims to hold 8% to 10% share of the $3.5 Bn Indian logistics market.\n\nAccording to the company’s annual report, in 2016, Asia Pacific contributed about $11.3 Bn to its parent Deutsche Post’s total revenue.

{"text": "Breed Reply Invests in Two More Early-Stage IoT businesses in Europe.\n\nEurope’s leading investor in early-stage IoT businesses has added two more investments, taking its portfolio to a total of 22 companies.\n\nThe new investments are: CageEye – The Norwegian company provides monitoring and a fully-automated feeding system for the global salmon farming industry using IoT technology to optimise production and reduce feed waste. ubirch – has created an IoT security system using blockchain technology. The German company has developed a sensor protocol to reduce IoT security risks and create a trusted solution.\n\n\n\nLONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–June 26, 2018–\n\nBreed Reply, a leading active operational investor in early-stage Internet of Things (IoT) businesses, has today announced two new investments, CageEye and ubirch. The companies have secured a total of €5.8 million in funding, including this investment round, since they were launched.\n\nThese new investments mean Breed Reply’s pan-European investment portfolio of early-stage IoT businesses has increased to 22 in a variety of different sectors. The sectors include health & wellness, industrial IoT, smart buildings and cities, security and platforms. So far, in 2018, Breed Reply has invested in four new IoT businesses with plans to grow the portfolio even further.\n\nThe new companies are:\n\nCageEye\n\nOslo-based CageEye has developed a world-leading AgTech platform. It is an IoT technology for the salmon farming industry designed to monitor the behaviour of the biomass in a cage and improve feeding processes. CageEye’s easy-to-install solution delivers fully automated, appetite-controlled feeding which can substantially reduce feed waste, which is a significant cost for producers. The system, developed in collaboration with the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, uses acoustic data and advanced analytics to detect when the fish are hungry or full.\n\nSome of the world’s leading salmon producers in Norway are already benefiting from the system. CageEye has identified opportunities to expand the use of the technology in Canada, Chile, Tasmania and Scotland, as well as with other aquaculture species. CageEye also has a biomass security solution, based on machine learning, in development.\n\nCageEye has raised a total of €2.3 million in funding and grants since 2016, including this round of investment since it first began to sell its product for commercial use. CageEye has already secured a further €1.5 million of investment as part of a new fundraising round in 2019.\n\nubirch\n\nubirch, based in Cologne and Berlin, has built a solution that enables a continuous chain of security and confidentiality for the collection, handling, and storage of data. This chain begins with an extreme lightweight blockchain client, that can be operated on any IoT sensor, even batteries. Each sensor that runs the protocol has a private key that generates a digital signature for every measurement, that is being transmitted. It means both the identity and integrity of the IoT data can be verified by anyone on the receiver side.\n\nCritical data is anchored in a two-layered blockchain-architecture. The ubirch solution, which is hardware agnostic, enables a wide range of IoT applications for infrastructures, buildings, machines, and devices with clients in the insurance, telecoms and manufacturing industries. Gartner, the leading IT market research and consulting named ubirch as one of the “Cool Vendors for Insurance” in 2017″. ubirch has raised more than €2 million since its launch in 2014, including this round.\n\nEmanuele Angelidis, CEO of Breed Reply, said: “Both of these companies have world-leading IoT technology in their respective fields. Importantly, they have solutions that fix real issues facing industry and have opened up the opportunity to develop new business models. CageEye has the potential to save the fish farming industry millions every year by increasing yields and reducing feed waste. ubirch uses blockchain to provide notary level trustworthiness for the Things, that are part of IoT, and the data they exchange. Each has ambitious plans for expansion, and we look forward to helping them realise these.”\n\nBendik S. Søvegjarto, CEO, CageEye said: “The salmon aquaculture industry is large and growing but facing challenges. The CageEye solution has been developed over many years to resolve one of the key problems facing producers, feed waste while helping them grow. Our unique IoT solution, which among other functions, offers a fully-automated feeding solution, will fundamentally change how producers resolve the problem. The funding from Breed Reply will support future R&D as well as our expansion into new markets.”\n\nStephan Noller, CEO, ubirch said: “Trust is the number one problem for IoT businesses today. The issue is holding back the implementation of IoT technology in many industries. ubirch offers the strongest security architecture using public and private key cryptography and blockchain technology. We have already seen strong interest from a number of leading multi-national corporations, and the support of Breed Reply will help us increase the take-up our technology.”\n\nThe two companies meet Breed Reply’s investment criteria of companies that combine strong management teams with an innovative technology that solves a real-world problem. As well as funding, Breed Reply will work closely with management to support both companies’ development to rapidly reach the next stage of development and follow-on investment rounds. Last year, one-third of Breed Reply’s portfolio raised more than $50 million of Series A funding.\n\nThe Breed Reply team has significant experience in scaling up early-stage businesses, in-depth understanding of different markets, proven track record in sales channel development and strong technological DNA. They also work closely with Reply Group, a leading consulting, systems integration and digital services company with a market presence all over Europe and the USA to help the investee companies commercialise their products.\n\n— END —\n\nAbout Breed Reply\n\nBreed Reply, Reply’s active operational investor, funds and supports the development of early-stage companies in the Internet of Things (IoT) in Europe and the USA.

{"text": "Flinks raises $500,000 to fuel mission of powering Canada’s FinTechs.\n\nMontreal-based Flinks has raised a $500,000 pre-seed round as the company works to be the go-to API solution for FinTechs in Canada.\n\nLaunched in April 2017, Flinks allows FinTech companies to connect their apps with customers’ banks, allowing them to validate account ownership, verify account balances, or access transaction histories. The problem sounds fairly straightforward, but CEO Yves-Gabriel Leboeuf says it’s a major challenge for FinTechs launching in the Canadian market.\n\n“There are new ways of evaluating the financial portrait of someone.”\n\n“Right now, there’s only one way to get that data, and it’s through an American provider,” Leboeuf says, citing examples like Yodlee and Finicity. “But the problem is that American providers don’t work closely with Canadian financial institutions.”\n\nThe company raised the money in a friends and family round that included the founders’ and early employees’ own money, and plans to use it to build up its eight-person team to focus on sales. It currently counts companies like Acceo and Dwello among its customers.\n\nWhile Flinks is focused on being an API provider right now, its long-term goal is to bring a more data-driven aspect to its API, such as assessing fraud risk or credit-scoring information of a user. Leboeuf says it could solve a financial inclusion issue for millennials.\n\n“There’s a special thing going on with millennials — we don’t really care about credit scores. We may pay cell phone bills late or credit cards late, and that affects credit scores and then we have difficulties getting financing,” Leboeuf says. “So there are new ways of evaluating the financial portrait of someone, such as the behaviour of someone who has money in their account, and what they do with pay deposit in their account. This is more where we want to go at this point.”\n\nWith a founding team that includes experience in financial firms like Desjardins and Laurentian, the team is optimistic about its lofty goal to reach one million end users by the end of the year. Currently, the company says it hits 1,000 validations a day, and continues to carve its niche in the Canadian market.\n\n“There’s a lot of international competition, but there’s more Canadian FinTechs going to the States than American companies going in the Canadian market,” Leboeuf says. “The reason is that most Canadian FinTechs are attracted by the US market because for some companies, Canada’s too small a market…we basically build tech to export it to the US market. A good example is Wealthsimple, which was first dedicated to the Canadian market but soon enough they decided to open on the US market, and I think it so far is working quite well.”\n\nHe continues, “We’re doing well so far, and differently than other companies or FinTechs in Canada by the fact that we’re trying to build everything for this market right now.”", "entities": [[0, 6, "org_in_focus"], [14, 22, "money_funded"], [71, 79, "headquarters_loc"], [86, 92, "org_in_focus"], [106, 114, "money_funded"], [115, 123, "type_of_funding"], [223, 227, "year_founded"], [229, 235, "org_in_focus"]]}

BitSight’s Series D financing was led by Warburg Pincus, with participation from existing investors Menlo Ventures, GGV Capital and Singtel Innov8. The financing enables BitSight to continue its rapid global expansion and extend its portfolio of market-leading security risk management solutions, while further validating BitSight’s leadership position as the global standard for security ratings.\n\nBitSight pioneered the security ratings market in 2011, as the first company to develop a security ratings product.

These cybersecurity scores will impact the degree to which other companies engage in high-value business with the organization. These scores will have an impact on cost/availability of cyberinsurance.”[1]\n\n“When BitSight introduced the first Security Ratings Platform in 2011, we set out to transform how businesses evaluate risk and security performance,” said Tom Turner, CEO of BitSight. “Over the last seven years, we’ve continued to deliver on this promise, providing tens of thousands of users with the deep insight needed to minimize risk within their environment. We know this is just the beginning, as there is still more work to do in continuing to establish a global standard for cyber security risk decisions. I am delighted to partner with Warburg Pincus as they have a very successful history of investments in cyber security, information services and global ratings agencies.”\n\nCary Davis, Managing Director of Warburg Pincus will join the Board of Directors. “With ever-increasing security threats, cybersecurity ratings are becoming an important part of leading companies’ cyber-defense. BitSight created the category and is the leader in the security ratings market, with a proven approach and platform to help customers continuously and effectively monitor cyber risk in their business ecosystem,” said Davis. “We believe there is tremendous opportunity for BitSight globally, and we look forward to working with Tom and the rest of the talented management team in the company’s next phase of growth.”\n\n“Warburg Pincus has a proven track record of investing in successful and impactful technology companies, led by outstanding management teams,” said Shaun McConnon, Executive Chairman of BitSight’s Board. “Their investment in BitSight is not only evidence of our market leadership and the long-term value of our security ratings platform, but also the steadfast leadership of our accomplished executive team and their ability to execute. Warburg invested in the future of security ratings, and that future is BitSight.”\n\nAbout BitSight\n\nFounded in 2011, BitSight transforms how organizations manage information security risk.

{"text": "Dreams: Sweden fintech app wants you to save and invest in a few taps.\n\nThe recent fintech revolution has given emergence to several mobile apps designed to help you stick to a budget, manage money, and stay financially secure.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, around 92 million ‘Millennials’ will soon be in ‘prime spending years.’ For this, we can give some credit to the host of startups that have emerged and are capitalising on this trend. One among them is Swedish fintech startup Dreams. Based out of Stockholm, the startup provides a unique and easy-to-use mobile application in a bid to help its users meet their financial dreams by re-inventing how financial services are designed.\n\nHave Dreams?\n\nThe Sweden-based startup is an application that allows creating services that empower users to live sustainably through improved savings, better use of income, smart investments, paying off debts and financial coaching on top of that. The platform offers savings and investment services to retail clients, primarily focused on serving millennials. Available on both web as well as a mobile app, this platform is live in Norway and Sweden. In collaboration with AXA IM, the expansion into other European countries is now on agenda – with Germany as the first market in continental Europe, where the app would be live by early 2020 and those interested can already sign up to be among the first users.\n\nImage credits: Dreams\n\nHenrik Rosvall, founder and CEO of Dreams, recently spoke to us about the mobile application platform and how he got into the business.\n\n“We have a methodology that helps people save more money, paying off debts and engage in their financial life in a very emotional way. The app is designed to give you small rewards while you save, so you don’t have to rely on the kick of buying that thing,” says Rosvall.\n\nHe has a diverse background working in various industries and has sold a couple of companies that he founded. He has been chief executive at EF Language Travel, as well as a marketing manager at Avanza Bank. He says, “I started looking into user behaviour and questioned myself on what makes people deposit money into the bank without investing.”\n\nHenrik also felt that the problem with investing seems so complicated that people do not want to start with it. He also pointed out that the traditional banks and conventional financial institutions haven’t eased our burden and further made it difficult and dull for most of us. And thus, Dreams platform was founded by Henrik Rosvall and Johan Hemminger.\n\nExpansion on cards!\n\nA week back, Dreams secured a MIFID II securities licence from Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) that gives the company a license to operate independently of a partner bank. With this licence, the company plans to expand in Europe on its own without relying on a partner bank. This is a significant step in Dreams’ European expansion, as the license can be easily passported to EU and EEA.\n\nTalking about the expansion plans, Rosvall says, “We are planning to expand to other European countries with our platform and different type of products.”\n\nHe adds, “We change people’s savings behaviour, and in turn, we realise their dreams.” At present, Dreams employs around 70 people in Stockholm and other locations.\n\n“We are building a different team for different products.” Also, Henrik is planning on hiring around 5-10 employees per month to focus on both product development and growth.\n\nWhen asked whether they plan to expand outside EU, Rosvall says, “We do have plans for other countries outside Europe but in a slightly different business model. We can use the same methodology all over the world, but we have to localise some of the product features as well.”\n\nRosvall further points out, “Asia is much more interesting than the US market. There is a lot of things happening there like a mobile revolution and an economic revolution.”\n\nImage credits: Dreams\n\nMarket share of 15% of millennials in Sweden and Norway\n\nAccording to Henrik, Dreams app is being used by over 400,000 users, who have collectively saved over €250 million. Furthermore, the fintech platform has gained a market share of 15% of millennials in Swedish and Norwegian markets.\n\nIt’s no secret that there is a significant gender gap within the field of financial services. However, Henrik told that a high proportion of Dream’s customers–69%—are female. He adds, “I think females are under served in financial services.” While there’s a long way to go in resolving the financial services gender gap, at some point, the tides are bound to turn.\n\nImage credits: Dreams\n\nSecured €9 million funding!\n\nRecently, the startup raised €9 million in a late seed round led by AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM), Storebrand, the Norwegian insurance company, Finnish Ålandsbanken and a group of private investors. However, the company is planning to raise more funding in the future. “It’s all about grabbing a bigger piece of the market, so we capital for that.”\n\n\n\nThe distinguishing feature of Dreams lies in the profound application of behavioural research in the methodology and user experience of the app. Rosvall states, “I really would like to push on the unique position that we have within financial wellness. We have been building products to help people get a more sustainable financial life.”\n\nBack in 2018, Dreams was named a Rising Star as part of the KPMG Fintech 100 Awards. Furthermore, the company along with Klarna and Anyfin was the only Swedish companies included on the fifth annual Fintech100 report earlier this year.\n\nSaving money is not a problem if there are appropriate services that fit our different behaviours and needs. This platform, with its unique methodology rooted in behavioural economics and cognitive science, offers a scientifically proven method to customers to secure their financial dreams.\n\nMain image credits: Dreams\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more European technology news.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Amsterdam-based Pride Capital Partners provides mezzanine loan to German social intranet app, COYO.\n\nIn a recent development, Hamburg-based social intranet app COYO has secured a mezzanine loan from Amsterdam-based Pride Capital Partners to finance its national and international growth strategy. Pride Capital Partners was previously known as Main Mezzanine Capital, and back then it provided a loan to leading Dutch online travel company Travelbird — which got acquired by UK’s Secret Escape recently.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nThis is the first loan offered by Pride Capital Partners since it became an independent mezzanine provider. According to the company, the mezzanine loan will be used to finance COYO’s expansion strategy. Initially, the focus is on supporting the continuous development of the platform and strengthening the sales channel for large and extra-large clients. However, the loan amount is not disclosed.\n\nWhat is a Mezzanine loan?\n\nAccording to Internet definition, ‘A mezzanine loan is a financing option that combines the elements of both debt and equity financing. It is considered as high-risk debt, but also offers high returns for the lender. In more simple terms, the mezzanine loan is a type of funding that can be transformed into an ownership/equity if the borrower fails to pay.\n\nIn case of Pride Capital Partners, it provides loans from € 2M and the focus is on SME companies with at least €3M in revenues, more than 20 employees and a strong track record with profitable growth.\n\nCOYO – serves as a digital home!\n\nFor the starters, COYO offers an in-house developed social collaboration and intranet platform that serves as a digital home for many medium to large companies in Europe. Furthermore, the platform is sold in a SaaS and private cloud model resulting in a scalable and recurring business.\n\nEnables companies to heighten their reach!\n\nAt present, the company employs around 100 people. With this platform, it enables companies to increase their reach amongst their staff and substantially promote content creation and collaboration within the staff.\n\nAdditionally, It helps employees to better identify themselves with their employer and the company culture as they are more democratically involved in decision-making processes and generally better informed about recent developments within the company.\n\nNotably, COYO has customers currently between 75.000 and 300.000 users active on the platform. Currently, only 30% of European enterprises use some sort of social collaboration platform.\n\nPride Capital Partners\n\nPride Capital Partners provides mezzanine loans to profitable and growing companies in the software and ICT market in the Benelux and DACH region. Currently, Pride Capital Partners is in the process of raising a Mezzanine fund with European Investment Fund amongst its institutional investor base.\n\nJan Marius Marquardt (Founder & CEO of COYO):\n\nWe’re very happy that our profitable and fast growth allowed us to attract a mezzanine loan from Pride Capital Partners. After becoming the leading German social and mobile intranet vendor with over 700.000 users and without external financing, the loan will now allow us to reach our international growth goals while maintaining the existing shareholder structure.\n\nLars van ‘t Hoenderdaal (Managing Partner of Pride Capital Partners):\n\nCOYO’s strong technology, scalable and recurring business model, combined with a very dedicated management team convinced us to provide the means for their growth strategy. The mezzanine loan is a perfect fit for COYO’s growth ambitions, allowing management and shareholders to secure their future without major changes in their legal and operational setting.\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more updates in the tech startup world.\n\nDid you know you can post your job for free on our job board?

{"text": "Cell Vault Joins the Fight Against Cancer, Raising $1 Million in Early Funding for First-Ever T-Cell Cryopreservation Bank.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, July 16, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Cell Vault , the world's first t-cell bank, announced today it has raised $1 million in an initial round of funding. The early investment in the company that offers t-cell banking for healthy individuals comes from Silicon Valley investors who share in the vision of t-cell cryopreservation as a tool in the fight against cancer.\n\n\"We see the future for CAR T-cell therapy to combat many kinds of cancers in addition to those currently approved by the FDA. Cell Vault is giving people the ability to preserve and bank healthy, strong t-cells for future cancer treatment,\" says Cell Vault founder Kevin Kirk. \"This initial round of funding marks an important milestone - these therapies, and future treatments, are now more accessible to patients who bank their healthy t-cells with Cell Vault before cancer strikes.\"\n\nCell Vault is developed from the same technology used to freeze eggs and bank cord blood. The technology lets people preserve the strongest version of their blood cells with a simple blood draw. Cell Vault \"banks\" or cryopreserves peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs. The purpose of the banking process is to ensure some of the strongest and most viable cells are available as a resource for future cancer treatment, should it ever be necessary.\n\n\"We are in the critical early stages with this technology,\" says Parameswaran Hari, MD, Cell Vault Advisor and Chief of Hematology and Oncology in the Department of Medicine at the University of Wisconsin. \"CAR T-cell therapy is still in early development but will be a household concept in the next few years. Right now, this therapy is approved for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, but hundreds of trials are currently underway to get it approved for a host of other diseases such as Breast Cancer.\" These other diseases are said to include, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma and ovarian cancer which are seeing encouraging results in clinical trials.\n\nT-cells are a component of the immune system that attacks cellular abnormalities. Dr. Hari describes T-cells as the \"cellular army of the immune system.\" CAR T-cell therapy removes T-cells from the body, modifies them and puts them back in the body \"supercharged\" to go after cellular mutations. Unlike conventional chemotherapy, CAR T-cells therapy is \"living therapy\" that permanently works to detect and attack cancer.\n\nIn 2019, 75K people are expected to be diagnosed with a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Many may find that they need to use their t-cells in CAR-T therapy treatment, to ultimately beat their cancer. T-cells not only decrease in number and deteriorate as you age, but they are negatively impacted through traditional chemotherapy treatments. Banking healthy T-cells now gives patients peace of mind of knowing they have one extra arsenal in a future battle with cancer.\n\nHow Cell Vault Works\n\nThe process is simple. Cell Vault clients order a kit online, schedule an in-home or in-office blood draw, a mobile phlebotomist completes the draw and sends the collected sample to the Cell Vault lab. The sample is then processed, frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored in perpetuity. To ensure the best outcomes for clients, Cell Vault has partnered with some of the nation's top CAR-T therapy doctors, the country's largest mobile phlebotomy company, and the USA's leading FDA-registered and CLIA certified lab to help their clients facilitate successful cell banking and deliver unparalleled service.\n\nFor more information, visit CellVault.com .\n\nAbout Cell Vault\n\nCell Vault is the world's first t-cell bank. Cell Vault makes it possible for people to prepare for a battle against cancer by banking the strongest versions of their t-cells.

{"text": "PIC, UIF partner to launch R2bn fund for startup companies in SA.\n\nThe SA government on Friday (14 December) launched a R2-billion fund to help small business startups that create jobs and contribute towards the growth and development of the economy.\n\nSANews reported on Friday that fund is part of the Project Development Partnership Fund (PDP) — established through a joint venture between the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), an entity of the Department of Labour.\n\nWhile the fund won’t exclusively be aimed at tech startups, but rather at all small business startups in general, the Minister of Labour Mildred Oliphant (pictured above) revealed that the fund will invest in projects that are focused on addressing South Africa’s socio-economic challenges through tech solutions aligned to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the fund in Pretoria on Friday, she said the fund is expected to create and support over 10 000 jobs.\n\nThe R2-billion PDP fund will invest in projects that are focused on addressing SA’s socio-economic challenges through techs solutions aligned to the Fourth Industrial Revolution\n\nIn addition, the fund will be directed specifically at performing the following roles:\n\nOffering funding to create and grow small businesses, therefore creating new companies.\n\nCreate companies in specific sectors such as agribusiness and bio-science, mining and beneficiation, manufacturing and ICT, social infrastructure, water and related services, financial services, and youth innovation.\n\nThe fund will also be investing in PIC Youth Fund, affordable housing and infrastructure funding.\n\n“New and transformed fund managers will also be created through this process. Through a transparent and competitive process, specialised black-owned fund managers will be selected to drive investments across the sectors,” said Oliphant.\n\nShe said this would create new black-owned fund managers in an industry where only 24% of players have a BEE score better than level four.\n\nFurthermore, there will be an emphasis on black youth and women-owned businesses at the underlying investment level, she said.\n\nIn addition, the UIF will seek to create synergies between the fund and training programmes through among other things, establishing an incubation programme aimed at supporting and training entrepreneurs and small businesses. The PIC would assist the UIF in facilitating this programme through a PIC academy for incubation.\n\nFeatured image: Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant during the launch of the new PDP fund (GovernmentZA via Flickr)", "entities": []}

{"text": "Convictional closes $3 million CAD as it looks to disrupt B2B trade.\n\nToronto-based Convictional, a startup with a B2B ecommerce platform to help vendors and brands manage inventory, has raised a $3 million CAD seed round, after graduating Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator (YC).\n\n“Our vision is to build a B2B trade network. One where we can connect businesses across any industry, in any market doing any form of B2B trade.”\n\nThe round was led by a mix of Silicon Valley investors like Lachy Groom, an early employee of Stripe, as well as AME Cloud Ventures, Tribe Capital, FundersClub, and also included Canadian VC firm Garage Capital, as well as other undisclosed investors. Convictional will use the new funds to build out more products and its engineering team. The company aims to help retailers expand their product catalogues by giving them access to more virtual supply chains and a network of potential partner brands.\n\n“To succeed with inventory, you need years of historical sales data or a time machine,” said Chris Grouchy, co-founder of Convictional. “The slowness and risk of inventory isn’t the right business model for ecommerce companies. Convictional helps modern retailers expand their product catalogues by giving them access to virtual supply chains and a network of brands.”\n\nThe company was founded by Grouchy and Roger Kirkness, who met while working together at Shopify and realizing what they thought was one of the biggest problems that merchants had: inventory. The pair founded the startup in 2017 and were accepted into YC for itsWinter 2019 Batch, a year later. Grouchy stated his desire to move Convictional back to Canada after graduating YC because of Canada’s pool of engineering talent.\n\n“We decided after Y Combinator to move back to Canada to build the company here because we felt that for the kind of business we wanted to build, the engineering talent is incredible and is on par with what we saw down in Silicon Valley,” Grouchy told BetaKit.\n\nRELATED: Shopify reveals Amazon-style fulfillment centres, 3D product display at Shopify Unite\n\nConvictional targets online retailers looking to onboard and integrate with third-party brands and vendors in order to sell products without taking on inventory risk. The startup is looking to address what it says is a $1 trillion problem – the fragmentation of B2B ordering, which Grouchy said creates friction for sales, IT, and ecommerce teams. Convictional’s solution is a centralized commerce platform that is meant to handle any order from any B2B customer.\n\nSince the 1960s, vendors have used Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems to manage transactional processes and documents like purchase orders and invoices, with the alternative being email and spreadsheets. Grouchy told BetaKit that as a result of market power dynamics, B2B ecommerce has become very fragmented, whereby large retailers can standardize all necessary business documents involved in procuring inventory, while for suppliers, the system can be “incredibly archaic.”\n\n“Today, you have suppliers and buyers that didn’t exist six years ago using tech from the 1960s to buy and sell. It’s the same dynamic I saw over and over in the early days of Stripe,” said Groom. “When I met Convictional, it became clear that better software and a smart approach to distribution could enable more commerce to happen between businesses.”\n\nThe way Convictional addresses this problem is by developing a B2B trade network for businesses across an industry or market, with tools that enable any party in a B2B transaction to use their preferred method of trade, regardless of who has market power. The platform automates the processes like onboarding, inventory, product information, and order syncing, integrating with both the supplier systems and buyer systems, aiming to simplify the way trade is conducted.\n\n“The whole goal is to start by automating as much of this as possible so that both sides can benefit,” Grouchy said, adding that the platform can reduce the time it takes to onboard a new vendor from five weeks down to minutes.\n\nRELATED: CoLab raises $2.7 million after Y Combinator Demo Day\n\n“Convictional’s vision is to build the B2B Graph,” said Kirkness. “Most B2B commerce relationships still exist offline. With better tools, we will reduce the friction involved in bringing those relationships online and enable more trade to happen.”\n\nSpending some time in the Valley offered Grouchy several key lessons he could take home. One of those lessons, said Grouchy, is that founders have to be scrappy to secure those initial users and that it is often necessary to build up some “believability” around the company or offering.\n\n“Oftentimes, a lot of startups, including ones at YC, often get bogged down by metrics on metrics. When, in reality, the metrics will come,” Grouchy noted. “What you should be focused on now is really understanding the story of the company, the story of the customer, and how the best team to solve it.”\n\nAlthough some of the new funds will be put toward growing Convictional’s engineering team, with the goal of eventually creating a sales team, Grouchy said the startup hires very slowly due to the high talent bar. He said he wants to keep the team lean and give employees as much agency as he can for them to execute well on the product.\n\n“Today, we’re starting by connecting brands to online retailers. Our vision is to build a B2B trade network,” Grouchy said. “One where we can connect businesses across any industry, in any market doing any form of B2B trade.”\n\nImage courtesy Convictional via Twitter", "entities": [[0, 12, "org_in_focus"], [20, 34, "money_funded"], [70, 77, "headquarters_loc"], [84, 96, "org_in_focus"], [196, 210, "money_funded"], [211, 215, "type_of_funding"], [494, 505, "investor"], [547, 565, "investor"], [567, 580, "investor"], [582, 593, "investor"], [630, 644, "investor"], [1532, 1536, "year_founded"]]}

The glove they’ve been developing allows to touch and manipulate virtual objects, just like you would in the real world.

{"text": "Flipkart Bolsters Artificial Intelligence Push By Creating An Internal AIforIndia Unit.\n\nIndia’s ecommerce behemoth Flipkart is taking big steps to make headway in the area of artificial intelligence by creating an internal unit called AIforIndia, in order to put machine learning and AI at the core of its business.\n\nIn an interview to Livemint, Flipkart co-founder and chairman Sachin Bansal stated that the ecommerce player will invest “hundreds of millions of dollars” in the AI initiative over the next few years. He also revealed that Flipkart has begun recruiting AI experts, building infrastructure, striking hardware partnerships and working with top educational institutions, including IITs in this direction. The new AI team will be headed by chief data scientist Mayur Datar with Bansal and Flipkart chief executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy directly working on some key projects.\n\nBansal said, “This is the next big thing for us, where we are betting big on the use of AI and machine learning to solve problems at Flipkart. India’s problems are unique and we need to apply AI in the ecosystem to solve Indian problems. We believe that some of the focus areas for AI in developed countries cannot be applied for India. At Flipkart, we will solve problems differently because the underlying problems (in India) are different.”\n\nBansal also added that Flipkart is looking for AI-related acquisitions in India and in the US.\n\nA Quick Look At Flipkart And Artificial Intelligence\n\nFlipkart’s artificial intelligence push with AIforIndia is not an entirely new thing. Flipkart first revealed its plans to experiment with AI in late 2015. As shared by the then Chief Product Officer of Flipkart, Punit Soni in an interaction with Inc42, the company will become more mobile-centric through the adoption of newer technologies such as artificial intelligence and social networks. He also added that heavy discount on an online purchase may not earn consumer loyalty and help build a user base in the long run.\n\nIn 2015, Flipkart had acquired the F7 Labs in the Silicon Valley to focus on AI and machine learning. As per an ET report, the 10-person Labs team is working on creating a model to determine which products get returned the most, so as to build a more cost effective way to manage those returns, and has automated the moderation of the comments and product reviews that appear on the site.\n\nThe company is currently running Project Mira, an artificial intelligence-focused effort, in stealth mode since last year. “On 28 February (2017), we launched the first version of our conversational search experience. Now, our users with broad intent (searching for, say, shoes or bedsheets) are guided by relevant questions, conversational filters, shopping ideas, offers and trending collections,” said Ram Papatla, Vice President of Product at Flipkart in an April 2017 ET interview.\n\nOn similar lines, Flipkart has partnered with Microsoft to reportedly deploy AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning)-based solutions to run future sales for the ecommerce unicorn.\n\nSimilarly Flipkart’s fashion unit Myntra too has been leveraging artificial intelligence and big data analytics to forecast fashion trends. In October 2015, it introduced Artie, an indigenously developed smart bot that gathers consumer insights to create a range of on-trend, fast fashion apparel under the ‘ModaRapido’ brand.\n\nGlobally, Amazon has also invested exhaustively in artificial intelligence to improve its marketplace. This year, Amazon also finally launched its most awaited product of the year – a smart, wireless speaker, Echo powered by its AI enabled virtual assistant Alexa in India.\n\nAs the world experiments more and more with artificial intelligence, Flipkart too, with its AIforIndia push, will try to solve problems of cart abandonment and frequent returns and apply it to wide range of areas both on the consumer facing side and on its supply side.", "entities": []}

It offers pan-India delivery services to ecommerce, pharmaceutical, automobile, cold-chain and fast-moving consumer goods companies.\n\nThe company last raised $50 Mn (INR 322 Cr) in its Series D funding round from Warburg Pincus and SAIF Partners.

{"text": "Oppenheimer family invests in 4Di Capital to back SA tech entrepreneurs.\n\nAmid increased calls by the private and public sectors for greater support of South Africa’s growing pool of entrepreneurial talent, local VC company, 4Di Capital, announced that E. Oppenheimer & Son has joined 4Di Capital Fund 1 as the fund’s newest investor.\n\nE. Oppenheimer & Son International is the investment holding company of the Oppenheimer Family interests, founders of the global mining company Anglo American, and managing shareholders of De Beers, the world’s leading diamond company, until its recent acquisition by Anglo American.\n\n4Di Capital has made seven investments in South African ventures so far, and recently announced its first profitable exit of mobile community startup Motribe Networks to MXit, the largest social network in Africa [read more about the Motribe deal]. The addition of the Oppenheimer family investment will double the size of the Fund, enabling 4Di to expand into further new investments while also having more capital available to accelerate the growth of its current portfolio.\n\nRachel Slack, a Director of E. Oppenheimer & Son, said, “We believe that South Africa has exceptional entrepreneurial talent and are excited to join the 4Di Capital family, where we hope we can assist in leveraging the resources available to us in support of young, high-impact entrepreneurs wishing to develop and launch their new innovations onto the global stage.”\n\n4Di Capital focuses on investing in early-stage technology ventures with global potential. This new addition to the company’s investor base brings together the extensive global networks of the Oppenheimer family with those of the current 4Di investors – including Reinet Fund S.C.A.,F.I.S. – and the venture investing and operating experience of 4Di.\n\nJustin Stanford, Founding Partner of 4Di Capital and co-founder of the Silicon Cape Initiative, said, “4Di Capital is well positioned to take full advantage of South Africa’s potential as a global technology innovation hub.”\n\nHe continued, “We are very pleased to have the Oppenheimer family on board to assist us in capitalising on the growing number of exciting new technology opportunities that need startup capital and support to penetrate the global market.”\n\nThe Oppenheimer family’s decision to invest in the South African technology industry is notable. Speaking to Stanford, we got the sense that the deal signifies the family’s desire to support and help drive young local entrepreneurial talent in South Africa and in fact, Africa. The World Bank noted that despite the global crunch, the African continent continues to draw positive growth outlooks thanks in large part to its oil and mining industries. The investment in 4Di could be seen as a way for the Oppenheimers to give back to the continent on which it founded its empire.\n\nSeed capital access in South Africa is a particularly challenging obstacle for startups. “It is not easy to find investors with a mandate and appetite for early-stage VC in SA. Globally the fund raising environment for VC is very challenging right now, and being an SA firm makes it even more challenging, so we are fortunate to locate investors for whom what we do is a fit. Despite the challenges, unique themes are still capable of drawing funding — thus with our unique team and positioning we have been successful,” says Stanford.\n\nThe deal underlines the belief that because of Africa’s untapped potential and unprecedented mobile penetration, it will increasingly draw attention from international tech investors.\n\n4Di has positioned itself to capitalise on the trend towards micro venture capital or seed accelerators, involving smaller investments and a quicker turn around to exit.\n\nLaurence (Laurie) Olivier, US based Senior Partner of 4Di Capital commented, “Recent shifts in technology and the global venture capital arena have created opportunities for entrepreneurs in emerging markets to take advantage of an increasingly integrated global technology landscape and lower cost of market entry, especially in the software, mobile and internet sectors. Barriers to entry have dropped significantly and now technological talent anywhere in the world has the potential to flourish if provided with the right enabling environment, capital and support.”", "entities": []}

{"text": "London-based event lead capture startup Akkroo secures about €2 million to accelerate the further expansion.\n\nLondon/Brixton-based event lead capture company Akkroo has closed a £1.75 million funding round led by Conviction Investment Partners (CIP), with participation from previous private investors. This raise forms the first part of Akkroo’s Series A round and the business will have access to further capital of an equal or greater amount in 12 months time. Akkroo will use the funds to increase its marketing activities and significantly expand its US operations.\n\nFounded in 2013 as a spin-out from RMP Enterprise, Akkroo enables sales and marketing teams to transform the way they capture, process and evaluate leads from exhibiting at events. It already has a global customer base across a wide range of verticals, including the likes of IBM, Sony, Getinge AB and PayPal. Unlike other event technology providers, Akkroo provides a ‘horizontal’ solution, aimed specifically at the organisations exhibiting at events, rather than the event organisers themselves.\n\nAkkroo allows event marketers to create powerful custom-built, fully branded data-gathering tools that function across iOS and Android mobile devices and tablets. With Akkroo-enabled devices, event teams on the trade show floor can capture detailed GDPR-compliant data from new leads in real-time, including business card transcription functionality and badge scanner integrations. The solution integrates with all major CRM and Marketing Automation platforms, allowing users to instantly and accurately transfer event qualified leads into existing sales and marketing workflows.\n\nThe young company solves a common pain point for enterprise businesses – how to ensure leads captured at events are recorded, qualified and processed efficiently, and how to prove the overall ROI of exhibiting, budget for which can often run into the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Using Akkroo means that companies have access to detailed data on both the value of exhibiting, and the performance of event teams on the ground. It also means companies can plan and allocate their upcoming event expenditure based on clear Akkroo data from past events.\n\nWith over $500bn spent on B2B events in 2017, the solution is primarily designed for industries where trade shows are an integral part of the sales process, and Akkroo has an exceptionally strong client base in the medical devices and life sciences industry. In many cases, Akkroo replaces entirely offline processes, with event leads traditionally captured by pen and paper on clipboards, or from business card ‘fishbowls’.\n\nAkkroo has been on a significant growth trajectory over the past years, more than doubling annual recurring revenue in the past two years and has recently moved to new headquarters in Brixton, south London to house its growing team. The young company has previously raised £150k in a small seed round in 2013, and £550k in a larger seed round in 2016. The business has been cash generative for a number of years.\n\nChris Wickson, co-founder and CEO of Akkroo, said: “This funding comes at a time of significant growth for Akkroo as we expand and develop our product in this emerging space, and seize the vast opportunities in both the European and US markets.\n\nHe continued explaining: “There is a huge disconnect between the manual, outdated activities that are used for lead capture when regularly exhibiting and an organisation’s existing, often sophisticated, sales and marketing systems. Businesses have long struggled with how to capture and process leads at events efficiently, follow up with those leads in a timely manner and ultimately evaluate the true ROI of exhibiting. What’s more, GDPR means that data collected and processed from events in a responsible manner is more important than ever. Akkroo is at the forefront of bridging this disconnect, solving a significant challenge that impacts sales and marketing teams all over the world. Our solution not only enables teams to win more business from events but also provides intelligence that ensures they’re exhibiting at the right events, at the right time.”", "entities": [[0, 6, "headquarters_loc"], [40, 46, "org_in_focus"], [61, 71, "money_funded"], [110, 116, "headquarters_loc"], [117, 124, "headquarters_loc"], [158, 164, "org_in_focus"], [178, 191, "money_funded"], [192, 205, "type_of_funding"], [213, 243, "investor"], [338, 344, "org_in_focus"], [347, 355, "type_of_funding"], [583, 587, "year_founded"], [623, 629, "org_in_focus"]]}

In addition to English and Hindi, Google has brought voice navigation in six additional Indian languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.\n\nVoice navigation in Hindi was added three years ago.\n\nIt has also introduced Zippr like Plus Codes, which are six character Plus city codes for locations. The codes can be generated, shared and searched by anyone by entering into the search field on Google or Google Maps. This will further enable searching temporary or time-bound addresses such as of events, business meets, etc.\n\nIt is not clear whether the voice navigation in regional languages and other features will also be available on Google Maps Lite.\n\nSuren Ruhela, Director, Google Maps Next Billion Users in a Google note stated, “To use a Plus Code, simply enter it into the Search field on Google or Google Maps on your mobile phones or desktops. That’s it. You’ll be instantly shown the location! Plus Codes can be used for a wide variety of reasons including communicating the venue of a temporary event, guiding emergency services to afflicted locations and providing an identifiable location for complicated addresses.”\n\nFor a long time now, Google Maps-enabled Uber and Ola users have also been struggling with the issues of missing addresses. To facilitate the process of accurate and easy searching on Maps, Google has also introduced ‘Add an Address’ – a feature that enables users, to contribute to the Maps experience from the Google Maps app.\n\n“Similar to adding businesses, users can submit new or missing addresses through this feature and we’ll make sure the address is searchable in due course after verification. And yes, you do get Local Guides points for each valid submission!” added Suren.\n\nOver the years, India has been a key market for Google and Google Maps.\n\nIn December last year, Caesar Sengupta, VP, Next Billion Users had announced the introduction of the two-wheeler mode in Google Maps as an India-first feature.\n\nHe stated, “Another India-first feature is the new ‘two-wheeler mode’ in Google Maps. India is the largest two-wheeler market in the world and the millions of motorcycle and scooter riders have different navigation needs than drivers of automobiles. Two-wheeler mode in Maps shows trip routes that use ‘shortcuts’ not accessible to cars and trucks. It also provides customised traffic and arrival time estimations.”\n\n“And since so many Indians rely on local landmarks for navigation, two-wheeler mode will show major landmarks on the route so that riders can plan their trip before starting and don’t have to keep checking the phone on the go,” Sengupta further added.\n\nWhile Google Maps has been focussing on localising its solutions to provide better navigation results, its competitor HERE Technologies has joined hands with NAVER Corporation to collaborate on autonomous indoor mapping technology.\n\nThe collaboration aims to combine NAVER LABS’ Scalable & Semantic Indoor Mapping (SSIM) technology, autonomous robots and AI-based image recognition capabilities with the HERE Open Location Platform to create, maintain and publish 3D maps of indoor environments such as airports and train stations.\n\nSuch maps are useful in various ways, from helping people find their way at complex transit interchanges to supporting the last mile guidance enabling a more efficient logistics.\n\nOver the last few years, HERE Technologies has customised its mapping solutions for fleet management, shipping and other B2B-oriented projects.\n\nHERE has also deployed a fleet of mapping vehicles equipped with motion sensors, 360-degree cameras and laser light radar (LiDAR), a combination of satellite and aerial imagery which helps process data to generate highly accurate maps.\n\nIn India, besides HERE Maps, while competing with Google Maps, Delhi-based MapMyIndia offers an entire API stack, IoT devices and a map app. MapMyIndia has mapped over 10.54 Mn unique destinations (Points of Interests), expanded coverage of over 2 Mn kilometres of road network, 7068 cities at street level with house address level data for 80 cities, 6 Lakh villages, and 3D & 2D landmarks in 86 cities.\n\nBesides adding local features such voice navigation in regional languages, plus codes, Google Maps, meanwhile, has also introduced “wheelchair accessible” routes in transit navigation.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180321005890/en/\n\nIn Netflix’s new documentary Take Your Pills, Alison Klayman (Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry) takes on how modern day pressures and the limitless possibilities of technology have addicted a generation to cognitive-enhancement drugs. Executive produced by Maria Shriver and Christina Schwarzenegger, Take Your Pills, features AlternaScript, a health tech start-up in Austin, TX. AlternaScript is challenging big pharma to help people optimize their lives without harming themselves with their premium nootropic, OptiMind. OptiMind is a state-of-the-art nootropic formula that combines the highest quality ingredients to enhance cognitive ability, energy and focus. Nootropics are substances that improve cognitive and executive function, memory, creativity and motivation.\n\nAlternaScript was founded in 2013 when Lucas Siegel, CEO and co-founder of AlternaScript, was in college. “After watching what seemed to be my entire college campus taking Adderall, I started researching what compounds could help people reach a new level of cognition without terrible side effects,” said Lucas Siegel. “The pressure to do and achieve more is a pillar of our human existence – but we believe you can achieve this without risking your health. We created OptiMind for one reason: to help people live longer and healthier lives through advancements in science and technology. We see this promise to help those most affected by the predatory pharmaceutical industry as a continuation of that vision.”\n\nOptiMind, like all of AlternaScript’s products, is based on extensive clinically studied research and rigorous testing. “OptiMind is a luxury brain supplement and has virtually nothing in common with commercial energy supplements commonly found on the market. We focus on the long-term health of your brain, not a quick pick-me-up that has limited value over time,” said Janet Kim, COO of AlternaScript. The hand-picked ingredients in AlternaScript products are unapologetically premium and have benefited from years of research. OptiMind is made in a cGMP certified lab and every ingredient in OptiMind undergoes rigorous purity testing with certification.\n\n“OptiMind is a revolutionary product conceptualized through quality and delivers on the needs of the consumer to be able to take the mind, our brain’s ability, to another level. OptiMind’s ingredients were grown ethically, with a high level of scrutiny for quality control, and tested through clinical studies. OptiMind delivers on the promise of the product; it has highly concentrated ingredients like Bacopa backed with clinical studies, not just herbal extracts with theoretical benefit,” said Adel Villalobos, Chief Scientific Officer at Lief Organics.\n\nAlternaScript has since launched four products that allow people to not just exist, but to thrive. The company is driven by purpose, donating 5% of their profits to help people recovering from off-label prescription drug abuse through the AlternaScript Recovery Fund.\n\nEvery customer gets a free sample of AlternaScript products with free shipping. AlternaScript has given over $2 million in free samples. Other AlternaScript products include a restorative sleep aid RestUp, a ground-breaking probiotic NuCulture, and a botanical-based premium weight loss multivitamin NatureThin.\n\nAbout AlternaScript\n\nAlternaScript is a premium health tech company that’s disrupting the healthcare industry by challenging traditional business models. AlternaScript’s direct-to-consumer model leverages technology, scientific advancements, and personalized care to modernize the health industry and bring products direct to consumers.\n\nThe company has built a philosophy focused on personalized care, guided by clinical studies, hard science, individual thought, and patience.

Anyone can register, go through the vetting process, choose how much they want to earn, and create a profile, with clients able to book candidates directly through the system, review them, and make payments.\n\nPeepz claims to have seen strong uptake in its first few months, and has now secured investment from marketing, events and promotions agency Sozala Media, which said it saw the disruptive value in the Peepz business model and the significant potential it offers to agencies and corporates both in South Africa and abroad.\n\n“In the current economy, brands are constantly looking for ways to be more efficient with their marketing spend, while maximising effectiveness at the same time. Peepz is a cog in the marketing mix that will deliver this, and we are super excited to be working with them,” said the Sozala Media partners.\n\nPeepz founder Nick Holdcroft said he was excited about what Sozala Media could brings to the table, aside from just investment money.\n\n“They bring support structures that build our capabilities. We now have a partner that will assist us in ensuring our clients are looked after, and can feel confident when booking through Peepz,” he said.\n\nHoldcroft said the startup had been growing rapidly over its first few months.\n\n“We’ve managed to sign up one of South Africa’s largest alcohol companies, and our list of agencies using Peepz, grows daily. We had a number of investment offers, but Sozala offered more than just funds, and that’s what triggered our interest,” he said.", "entities": [[0, 2, "headquarters_loc"], [25, 30, "org_in_focus"], [76, 81, "org_in_focus"], [96, 114, "type_of_funding"], [214, 218, "year_founded"], [220, 225, "org_in_focus"]]}

But, there are a few domains that remain difficult to digitise and physiotherapy is one such field. However, Germany based digital therapeutics company Kaia Health has managed to digitise the process to offer 2D motion tracking technology.

Recently, Silicon Canals received an opportunity to chat with the company’s CEO Konstantin Mehl, and we found out more about what the startup is planning to do next and more.\n\nFunding details\n\nThe latest round of funding for Kaia Health was its Series A extension where, as mentioned earlier, the company raised €7.22 million. The funding round was led by Optum Ventures and the company will be utilising the fresh funds to accelerate its sales growth in the US health care market, extending its platform into other chronic indications and expand the supporting clinical evidence base.\n\n“The investment from Optum Ventures will allow us to explore integration opportunities throughout the complete patient treatment journey,” says Konstantin Mehl, Founder and CEO of Kaia Health. “We are proud to partner with Optum Ventures, a company at the cash forefront of improving health care.”\n\nThe idea\n\nAlmost every startup has a core idea that it is built around and Kaia is no exception. The company’s founder suffered from chronic back pain and ended up at a pain center to perform four weeks of full-time therapy, which is called the multimodal pain therapy. This is where the idea for Kaia app was born and the multimodal pain therapy is what the app digitised and is making it available for everyone.\n\nHow Kaia app works\n\nThe Kaia Health app can help users relieve Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSK) such as chronic back pain. It covers physical exercises, offers Physiotherapeutic strengthening exercise, relaxation exercises, along with background information about back pain. Mehl says that the daily exercise program is tailored for a user and it takes up 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the user’s pain history and feedback.\n\nThe Kaia back pain app is available for download via the App Store and Google Play with a 7-day free-trial. Currently, it is available in English and German and the company is planning to add more languages by early 2020.\n\nIt uses AI!\n\nOne of the most exciting elements of the Kaia app is that it employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver real-time feedback. The app makes use of AI-powered motion tracking technology that is said to deliver real-time feedback on how well one is performing the physical exercises.” It’s like having a physical therapist at your side, from the comfort of your home – and users love it. As it’s based on AI, it’s available 24/7, so you don’t have to schedule a time with your personal coach or anything like that – it’s very convenient.” Mehl notes.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWhile Kaia Health has already revealed what it intends to do with the funds it has acquired in the latest round, we asked the CEO about the direction the company is headed towards. As per Mehl, Kaia has a business headquarter is situated in New York. “It already works with some of the biggest players in the healthcare system to integrate Kaia in the general treatment landscape. Our goal is to integrate Kaia wherever patients with repeat back pain require a solution. We’re also investing a lot in clinical research and building our computer vision capabilities,” says Mehl.\n\nFounder’s advice for funding seekers\n\nFor those of you who are the proprietor of a startup looking to get some funding, here’s some advice for you from Kaia Health’s CEO. Mehl firmly believes that one needs to build a product or a service that the users will fall in love with, and prove this to the investors. However, most founders overlook this when they raise their seed round.\n\nImage credits: Kaia Health\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more European technology news.", "entities": [[0, 6, "headquarters_loc"], [15, 26, "org_in_focus"], [34, 40, "money_funded"], [799, 810, "org_in_focus"], [849, 862, "money_funded"], [1120, 1131, "org_in_focus"], [1140, 1148, "type_of_funding"], [1207, 1220, "money_funded"], [1251, 1265, "investor"]]}

Crusoe currently has flare mitigation projects operating in Wyoming's Powder River Basin oilfield, Colorado's Denver-Julesburg oilfield and North Dakota and Montana's Bakken oilfield. Systems are scalable up to millions of cubic feet per day and can be deployed anywhere in the United States or Canada.\n\nBackground on Flaring\n\nNatural gas flaring has become an acute pain point for shale oil producers, which produce natural gas as a byproduct of oil. This oil-associated natural gas production has outpaced gas pipeline infrastructure in many parts of the North American shale boom. In the absence of adequate pipeline capacity, operators tend to burn natural gas in a process known as \"flaring\" or \"combusting.\" Approximately 497 billion cubic feet of natural gas are flared annually in the United States, according to data from the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), which is enough gas to power more than 10 million U.S. homes. Flaring generates pushback from the public and policymakers, who increasingly raise environmental concerns around resource waste, visual impacts and air quality.\n\nAbout Bain Capital Ventures\n\nBain Capital Ventures partners with disruptive founders to accelerate their ideas to market.

After completing the two year payment plan, customers will own outright their solar TV set as well as their home power system.\n\n“Owning a TV is life-changing for our off-grid customers. Many of them have traditionally had to pay to watch in a café or bar, or missed out on news and current events because they could not afford to be connected to information. We are now going beyond the grid to offer TV to homes all over Kenya. It’s great for the family to be able to watch together in the comfort and safety of their home,” says Jesse Moore, chief executive officer (CEO) at M-KOPA.\n\nThe new M-KOPA 400 package – a 20W solar home system – is now also available in selected service centres. The package includes a 20W PV panel, a 16 inch digital TV, two lights, a torch, a phone charger, and a radio; and is available for a deposit plus a year of daily payments of KES125 (US$1.2).\n\nM-KOPA has partnered with mobile operator Safaricom since 2010 on technology development and distribution in Kenya. M-KOPA’s solar home systems, with TV, will be available in Safaricom retail outlets from mid-2016.\n\n“M-PESA and Safaricom are helping make digital TV affordable and accessible for the first time for millions of people. I think M-KOPA’s innovation signals a fundamental change for TV audiences in Kenya. We are creating the genesis of a new economy based on clean energy that promises to include groups who have been previously marginalised,” says Bob Collymore, CEO of Safaricom.\n\nThe solar TVs are the latest in a line of technology and home development products rolled out by M-KOPA in addition to its power system. In January Disrupt Africa reported M-KOPA had so far sold 40,000 home-improvement and technology products, including lights, energy-efficient cooking stoves, smartphones and water tanks. The product range is only available for households who have successfully completed the payment plan on their solar home systems.\n\nM-KOPA Solar raised a total of US$31.45 million in funding last year – making it one of the best-funded startups in Africa according to Disrupt Africa’s African Tech Startups Funding Report 2015.", "entities": []}

More than 2,000 schools nationwide currently use ClassWallet to automate processes for transactions for over 63,000 teachers and principals, freeing up tens of thousands of man-hours.\n\n\n\n\"It's particularly exciting for us to support a project that employs the latest technology to solve a very practical problem that ultimately has such meaningful impact on real people, and ultimately and especially-kids,\" said Tom Wallace, Managing General Partner Florida Funders. \"ClassWallet is a uniquely high value product with great potential.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the most relevant initiatives the new funding will help empower is developing and implementing functionality to support management of education funding to families for tuition payments and other educational services and needs, a widely used educational model in Florida and other states. Another exciting initiative the new funding will support is the implementation of a statewide rollout of ClassWallet in New Mexico as part of a new contract with the New Mexico Public Education Department. Ultimately, ClassWallet is poised to help address a $23 billion problem nationwide.\n\n\n\nAfter creating AdoptAClassroom.org-a portal that allows anyone to donate classroom supplies for participating schools, and considered by many as the first crowdfunding website-inventor Jamie Rosenberg found that the mechanics of getting and tracking money for teachers and school systems was time-intensive, diverting precious time and energy from their core mission. He conceived ClassWallet as a tailored solution.\n\n\n\nLike many large bureaucracies, school systems have a complex web of transactions and expenses administered by countless teachers, administrators, support staff, foundations and PTAs. Ordering classroom supplies, stocking offices, paying for conference expenses, or running the latest PTA fundraiser, hardworking educational staff spend countless hours processing receipts for even the smallest transactions. On the other end of the process, bookkeepers are burdened with processing mounds of messy paperwork.\n\n\n\nSchool districts, state government, K-12 scholarship organizations and related non-profits use ClassWallet's simple, consolidated platform that includes a virtual wallet, integrated eCommerce marketplace, reimbursement management, declining balance reloadable debit card, and integrated crowdfunding powered by GoFundMe.\n\n\n\nSome of ClassWallet's features include digital receipt capture for debit cards and reimbursements, transactions with electronic review workflow, automated invoice payment, automated direct deposit reimbursement and automated reconciliation. In addition to maximizing efficiency of this time- and cost-intensive process, ClassWallet saves bookkeepers and teachers countless hours while mitigating risk and fraud with built-in safeguards.\n\n\n\nClassWallet has attracted extensive media attention including a Wall Street Journal article by Leslie Brody that recognized the products' impact, stating, \"About 2,600 district teachers and 58 principals can tap into the gifts from $100 to $7,500 through ClassWallet, which gives access to vendors and tracks spending.\"\n\n\n\n\"Florida Funders' support has come at a most fortunate time when the Company is experiencing explosive growth.

{"text": "Startup Policy Rundown: Impact Of Budget, Tamil Nadu Startup Policy Launch, And More.\n\nThere was a time when budget presentations in India were made peppered with quotes, adding some colour to an otherwise serious affair and giving the media and people at large talking points. While presenting the landmark 1991-92 Budget, the then finance minister Manmohan Singh had quoted French poet Victor Hugo: “No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.”\n\nThe quote was apt and contextual. The year was 1991. India had faced the worst economic crisis since independence. With barely $I Bn in its foreign reserve, which was hardly enough to pay for two weeks of imports, India had sought funds from the IMF and, as part of the conditions imposed by the IMF, Manmohan Singh had abolished the License Raj / Permit Raj.\n\nCut to 2019. At a time when India’s forex reserve stands at $396 Bn, counting on the Startup India programme of the Modi government, interim finance minister Piyush Goyal simply said: “Jo job seeker tha vo job creator ban gaya (People who were once job seekers have now turned job creators, thanks to the Modi government)!”\n\nWhether job creators — namely startups, which according to Inc42 DataLabs, now number 39,000, having increased almost 7x in the last 10 years — have addressed the unemployment problem or can even address the Inda’s looming unemployment issue in future is debatable.\n\nFurther, startups the world over are viewed as impact creators, through their innovative ideas and their implementation. And, job creation is a by-product for them. The burden should not be the other way around.\n\nThe Modi government, which can be given its due credit for helping develop the startup ecosystem in the country, must understand that startups’ primary job is to innovate and not create jobs.\n\nAmid a slew of historic reforms such as FDI, GST, digital payments, and more, startups, on their part, expected the government to address tax-related policies affecting their ecosystem.\n\nBut ahead of the General Election 2019, the interim finance minister, while delivering the Budget speech on February 1, missed a huge opportunity to address the core concerns of startups and remove the roadblocks that are hindering the growth of the startup ecosystem in India.\n\nThese were the demands of the Indian startup ecosystem from the Budget:\n\nRelated Article: Tamil Nadu To Launch Startup Policy Within The Next Three Months\n\nCreation of a Medical Innovation fund to support medtech and epharma startups\n\nCreation of a Defence Innovation Fund to support defence startups\n\nReduction in GST from 18% to 5% for edtech startups\n\nReduction in GST on EV components\n\nExtension of Section 80-IAC beyond the current three years\n\nAutomation of the route to Section 80-IAC as well as angel tax exemption\n\nAllowing FDI in epharma similar to ecommerce\n\nA tax breather (deferring TCS) for ecommerce companies\n\nMaking the Government eMarketplace (GeM) more open and incorporative for startups\n\nSimplification of TDS, repayments in online lending\n\nImprovement of employability through Reskill India\n\nIntroduction of an epharma policy\n\nIn Interim Budget 2019-20, some major demands that were met by the government are:\n\nThe tax rebate to the middle class in the INR 2.5 Lakh to INR 5 Lakh income category, which will bring liquidity back in the market\n\nReduction in import duty on EV components\n\nNational AI Programme and the creation of an AI portal\n\nAngel tax exemption remained a big issue for startups despite umpteen letters written by startups to the government and meetings between startup stakeholders and government officials.\n\nAfter the February 4 roundtable conference among various startup-related associations and platforms and the Department for the Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) officials, CBDT officials are expected to work along with the key startup stakeholders to devise a new draft notification to safeguard startups.\n\nThe development came after around 70 startups signed a letter addressing the PM and demanded that the government safeguard startups from the draconian angel tax law.\n\nIn Interim Budget 2019, however, there were a few announcements that will directly or indirectly boost the Indian startup ecosystem. These were:\n\nAmending Direct Taxes policies\n\nA full tax rebate has been proposed for individuals in the tax slab of INR 2.5 Lakh to INR 5 Lakh. Hence, if the Section 80C benefits are availed, individuals need to pay no taxes on an income up to INR 6.5 Lakh. This will boost liquidity in the market and help digital startups, particularly online lending, payments, healthtech, ecommerce, and other consumer markets.\n\nNational AI Programme\n\nGoyal, in an undisputedly welcome move, announced plans to launch the National Programme on Artificial Intelligence (AI). He said that the nine priority areas for the programme have been identified — healthcare, education, agriculture, smart cities, and smart mobility being some of the identified priorities. He added that Centres of Excellence (CoEs) will be established and a National Artificial Intelligence portal will be developed soon.\n\nDigital Village Mission\n\nFollowing the concept of the Smart Cities Mission, Goyal announced plans to create 1 Lakh digital villages across the country. This will connect villages through optical fibre networks as well as better transport facilities.\n\nMost digital startups which run through mobile apps have not been able to penetrate rural India due to the lack of digital as well as transport infrastructure. The Digital Village Mission will help startups tap India’s rural market as well.\n\nTamil Nadu Govt Launches Startup Policy, To Set Up Startup Fund\n\nOne of the emerging states under the DPIIT’s State Startup Ranking framework, Tamil Nadu has now taken a step forward by launching its Startup and Innovation Policy 2018-2023, which was unveiled by the state chief minister K Palaniswami on January 19.\n\nThe aim of the policy is to provide an enabling ecosystem for startups registered in the state and to make Tamil Nadu a global innovation hub by 2023. The mission will also target creation of a minimum of 100K high-skilled jobs, both direct and indirect, in the startup ecosystem.\n\nThe new policy includes setting up of a startup fund, to be called Tamil Nadu Startup Fund of Funds, with a corpus of INR 250 Cr ($21 Mn) for investments in startups. It will be managed by a professional financial agency such as the Small Industries Development Bank of India.\n\nThe first tranche of INR 25 Cr ($3.5 Mn) will be allotted in the financial year 2019-2020. It will be registered as an alternative investment fund (AIF) under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulation, 2012.\n\nAssam Incubation Centre To Help Startups Accelerate Growth\n\nAssam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal has launched an incubation centre named Assam Startup – The Nest as part of the Assam Startup Policy 2017. The aim of the initiative is to provide infrastructure and mentoring to startups in the state, thereby accelerating their growth.\n\nThe centre has already started inviting applications from eligible startups, which, according to its website, should “have at least a minimum viable product (MVP) with a proof of concept (PoC)” and should “ideally have demonstrated some traction from customers.”\n\nThe Guwahati-based incubation hub will offer facilities such as access to design and testing labs, workspaces, business assistance, financial counselling, legal and regulatory guidance, networking, and mentoring. The hub will also play the role of a catalyst to help startups connect with the right investors.\n\nFrom northeastern states like Assam and Manipur to Jammu & Kashmir in the north and now Tamil Nadu in the south, in the last five years, almost 20 states have come up with state-oriented startup and Innovation policies, thanks to the Centre’s Startup India Mission.\n\nHowever, just like technology, policies, too, have an expiry date, and the government must continue with the policies reforms to keep up sustained support to the startup ecosystem.\n\nThat’s it for this month, see you all folks, next month!", "entities": []}

This financing, in addition to funding secured from several other strategic investors, will support incorporation of the ClonoSIGHT minimal residual disease (MRD) test into clinical trials of medicines in development for various hematological malignancies (blood cancers) and development of new clinical diagnostics based on Sequenta's revolutionary LymphoSIGHT platform.\n\n\n\nMRD refers to the small numbers of cancer cells that remain in a patient's body during or after treatment that can be reliably detected only by using sensitive molecular technologies. Testing for MRD can help determine whether cancer treatment has been successful, provide important information about patient prognosis and help guide additional treatment decisions.\n\n\n\n'The ability to measure depth and quality of responses using MRD assays will enable scientists to monitor the clinical impact of existing and novel emerging therapies in hematological and other cancers. Sequenta's technology also has potential applications in the study of immune therapy approaches in solid tumors and immune inflammatory diseases,' said Rajesh Chopra, M.B.B.S., Ph.D., Corporate Vice President, Translational Development at Celgene Corporation. 'This investment in Sequenta is reflective of our belief in Sequenta's approach and part of our broader commitment to play a leading role in immunotherapy across a number of therapeutic concepts.'\n\n\n\n'The ClonoSIGHT MRD test has been validated across multiple blood cancers, and is used as a clinical decision-making tool by physicians at major cancer centers throughout the United States,' said Tom Willis, CEO of Sequenta. 'Celgene's investment in Sequenta, along with the other strategic investors, will further support adoption of our powerful minimal residual disease detection and quantification technology as the emerging standard for response assessment and disease monitoring in clinical trials of medicines for blood cancers, as well as the development of new applications of our LymphoSIGHT platform.'\n\n\n\nAbout the ClonoSIGHT Process\n\n\n\nSequenta's ClonoSIGHT process enables physicians to utilize sequencing-based minimal residual disease (MRD) detection as a clinical decision-making tool for patients with lymphoid cancers (blood cancers). Clinical validation studies have shown that this process, which utilizes Sequenta's LymphoSIGHT platform, offers significant improvements in sensitivity and performance over other MRD detection methods.\n\n\n\nMRD detection and quantification using the ClonoSIGHT process involves two steps that are easily integrated into patient care. In the first step, the ClonoSIGHT ID test, cancer cell DNA sequences are identified in a diagnostic sample. In the second step, the ClonoSIGHT MRD test, follow-up samples are screened for the previously identified sequences in order to detect residual disease. ClonoSIGHT test results are generated in seven days using Sequenta's CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory. These results are provided to the ordering physician in a simple, actionable report that shows a patient's MRD status and level, as well as MRD trends over time via a secure online portal. The ClonoSIGHT process has been validated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. For more information, please visit http://www.clonosight.com.\n\n\n\nAbout the LymphoSIGHT Platform\n\n\n\nSequenta's LymphoSIGHT platform is a simple and scalable laboratory process that allows each of the several million B and T cells (lymphocytes) in a blood or tissue sample to be characterized and enumerated. Individual cells can be detected at levels as low as one cell per million white blood cells. The LymphoSIGHT platform combines proprietary multiplexed PCR assays for the universal amplification of rearranged immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes with powerful algorithms for the analysis of next-generation sequencing data.\n\n\n\nSequenta has commercialized the LymphoSIGHT platform for clinical use in minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in lymphoid cancers as the ClonoSIGHT process. The company is also investigating the use of the LymphoSIGHT platform in a diverse set of immune-mediated diseases and as a method for evaluating the efficacy of therapies based on immune system modulation.\n\n\n\nAbout Sequenta\n\n\n\nSequenta is a biotechnology company dedicated to improving patient care in diseases mediated by immune cells through the discovery and development of novel clinical diagnostics. The company, located in South San Francisco, was founded in 2008 and has received venture funding from Mohr Davidow Ventures, Index Ventures and Foresite Capital.

The investment amount remains undisclosed.\n\nBased in Pune, Benoit is an online fashion platform that specialises in men and women’s apparel. As stated by CEO Vishal Singh, the design process, which extends over a period of several months, starts with the sourcing of the most sustainable and aesthetically pleasing fabrics.\n\nThe focus is on making the latest fashion trends available to women as well as men. The designers at Benoit also ensure proper fitting for different body types. The fashion startup caters primarily to millennials.\n\nSpeaking about the last investment from Deepak Nathani, Singh stated, “This funding will be utilised for scaling-up faster by adding more designs and expanding the marketing efforts. The brand also stands to benefit with Mr. Nathani’s sustained mentorship which will help the firm grow.”\n\nHeadquartered in Pune, Cybage is an IT consulting company that was founded in 1995.

{"text": "AltExchange Alliance winds down after strategic review.\n\nAltExchange Alliance, a nonprofit formed in 2012 to build reporting standards for the private equity industry, decided to wind down. The group’s board of directors made the decision in March. AltExchange’s board commenced a strategic review last year with Leodoran Financial.\n\nPress Release\n\nBy way of background, in 2012, the AltExchange Alliance came together with a charter to define and maintain a set of common data standards for the private equity industry. Since that time, a variety of representative organizations from across the industry came together as AE members, led by a volunteer board representing limited partners, general partners, advisors and technology vendors. The Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) has also been an active participant, joining the AE board in 2015.\n\nSince its inception, AltExchange has worked on several important initiatives. This includes the development of key reporting templates, from robust partnership reporting and cash flow templates to one that contains critical portfolio company metrics. Most importantly, AE members have promoted the idea throughout the industry that standardized reporting in a digital format will ultimately lead to improved transparency, back office efficiency gains, improved portfolio management and reduced costs.\n\nThis evolution is critical given the heightened importance of private equity as an investment strategy, in line with the need for institutional investors to better integrate their PE exposure into a portfolio risk management framework.\n\nAlthough the AltExchange digital reporting format did not become an industry standard, AE’s influence has contributed to significant change in the reporting landscape. AE members were involved in the creation and release of the ILPA reporting template (and others set to be released over the next year) and in the development of a variety of new reporting technology solutions that are now available to both general partners and limited partners.\n\nConsequently, in the second half of 2017, the AE board commenced a strategic review of the organization in light of recent industry changes. This included the engagement of Leodoran Financial, which worked closely with the board to analyze the current market landscape and develop potential paths forward for the organization. Since the fall, there have been multiple board calls and discussions, taking into account Leodoran’s observations on the market and operational alternatives for AltExchange to pursue in the future. The board assessed the viability of a sustainable funding model and questioned whether there was sufficient rationale for AE to continue in a role of socializing the implementation of standardized financial reporting.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the board determined that enough industry momentum had been established, supported by industry groups and commercial technology enterprises, such that AE’s existence ceased to have the same need as was the case in 2012.\n\nTherefore, the board has started the process of winding down AltExchange Alliance, which we hope to conclude in the next 30 days. We thank all AltExchange members for your financial support and industry promotion of standardized financial reporting.\n\nWe are confident and comforted by the fact that the industry is heading in the right direction given the pace of recently adopted reporting standards as well as the rapid technological innovation that is quickly resolving the reporting inefficiencies that AltExchange attempted to address. We also look to industry groups such as ILPA, American Investment Council, and Invest Europe – not to mention the efforts of individual investment organizations – to continue to drive the adoption and implementation of uniform, robust financial reporting protocols for private equity in the future.\n\nwww.AltExchange.com", "entities": []}

Hadoop is a centralizing point in many enterprises for big data, and competitive solutions all require the decryption of information in order to build predictive analytic models.\n\nRichard Clarke will also join Context Relevant’s Advisory Board, which currently includes Mike Kail of Netflix, Darren Vengroff, chief scientist at RichRelevance, David Farber, professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and Gary Kazantsev of Bloomberg.\n\nThe two companies are combining forces to help customers address some of the most difficult and urgent data security breaches, possible compliance violations, cross-border data residency laws, and other threats that are emerging from massive data analytics being performed on architectures like Hadoop.\n\nContext Relevant contributes its uniquely powerful data analytics engine – delivering predictive analytics solutions for understanding customer behavior, including impersonation and identity theft. Good Harbor offers its expertise on how corporations and governments manage their cybersecurity risks.\n\n“Cybersecurity is both a national security and an economic challenge that the U.S., its allies, governments and companies face today,” said Richard Clarke, chairman and CEO of Good Harbor Security Risk Management. “One of the greatest obstacles to conquering cybersecurity is the challenge of analyzing the enormous amount of data that is required to adequately combat specific threats. That’s where Context Relevant and its highly credentialed team of experts in data science come into play. Their technology will be a force multiplier to help organizations avoid massive data security issues.”\n\nThis timely partnership comes as several major retailers, banking institutions and entire nations like South Korea and Germany are dealing with aggressive and financially disruptive attacks by cyber terrorists. According to the FBI, cyber attacks are surpassing terrorism as the U.S.’ major domestic threat. In fact, data breaches are among the most common and costly security failures in organizations of any size, with companies being attacked an average of two million times a week. 1\n\nAdditionally, Good Harbor’s recent report titled, “Securing Cyberspace Through International Norms,” highlighted the fact that, “Cyber crime, cyber espionage, and even cyber war have in recent years become issues of immediate concern to senior government leaders and industry executives, threatening to undermine the great benefits of a globally networked society. Cyber criminals have stolen hundreds of billions of dollars worth of personal, business-sensitive, and financial information, largely from the private sector.” 2\n\n“Companies need their data analysis to work faster and smarter than the malware and deep persistent threats that attack them. Every few milliseconds, our machine learning software is already doing what other data analysis models take weeks and even months to do. If you put that in terms of security breaches, time is money – and lots of it,” said Stephen Purpura, CEO and co-founder of Context Relevant. “We have the technology, and with the addition of Richard Clarke to our Advisory Board and our partnership with Good Harbor, we now have the cybersecurity expertise to offer clients comprehensive solutions. We’re thrilled to work with Clarke and to tap into his vast knowledge.”\n\nRichard Clarke, Stephen Purpura and other key members of the Good Harbor and Context Relevant teams began their nine-year relationship during their time at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Mass. Clarke was teaching a course on National Security Program Management and Purpura and others were students. Clarke was already an internationally recognized expert on cybersecurity, homeland security, national security, and counterterrorism. He served the last three Presidents as a senior White House Advisor, including as Special Advisor to the President for Cyber Security and National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism.\n\nStephen Purpura’s resume includes more than 20 years of data science, invention, advanced academic achievement and software product development. He is recognized as a leading expert in the fields of machine learning, micro-targeting and predictive analytics.\n\nAbout Context Relevant\n\nContext Relevant delivers predictive analytics apps based on models that can predict changes in your operations, your customers, your product pricing and even what your IT systems are about to do.

Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma told a news report that the company discovered the Paytm Mall scam last year.\n\n“Post Diwali [2018], what my team saw was that there were some small sellers who were getting a large percentage of the cashbacks and we as a team asked our auditors to do a deeper audit. We found out that there were some sellers who were colluding with some employees at the junior-level and they, sort of, will get more cash back on their products,” the Paytm founder was quoted as saying in a news report\n\nPaytm Mall Scam: Employees Fired, Sellers Delisted\n\nThe company has taken action against the “wrongdoers” which includes delisting “hundreds of sellers to ensure there are only brand sellers on the platform”. The company will now only allow authorised brand sellers to sell products on Paytm Mall\n\n“We first used to believe that every seller should be able to sell on Paytm mall. Right now, we stringently clear only the authorised brand sellers. For instance, in a product like the iPhone, earlier a small mom and pop store could also sell it online. All such sellers have been removed and now only authorised brand sellers would be able to sell that,” Sharma added.\n\nThe company has also sacked “tens” of employees. Paytm Mall had partnered with E&Y to build a technology-based fraud prevention system.\n\nThe firm was roped in to investigate an alleged cashback fraud involving its staff members. However, the case hasn’t deterred Sharma’s belief in the cashback model. He still believes that the model is sustainable. However, he says that profitability may be some time away as it is spending more on on-boarding users and merchants currently.\n\nSharrma added that Paytm would not be profitable till its user base reaches 500 Mn from 300 Mn and merchant base swells to 40 Mn from the current 12 Mn.\n\nPaytm Mall’s Rough Patch\n\nIt is notable that after a rejig of top-level management at Paytm Mall, the company has also followed it with over 80% cut down in cashbacks across its online marketplace categories such as grocery, electronics and fashion. The cut down had also led to reduction in the users of Paytm Mall, but considering the fraud that has come up, it may not have been a bad decision.\n\nPaytm Mall has been losing market share, slipping from 5.6% of the market in 2017 to a mere 3% in 2018. App Annie data also showed that the company’s active users have halved to 4 Mn in March from the 8 Mn in October.\n\nPaytm Mall reported a net loss of $245.65 Mn (INR 1,800 Cr) during the FY18, nearly 150 times its net loss of $1.86 Mn (INR13.63 Cr) in the previous financial year. The company’s finance costs also multiplied, reaching $6 Mn (INR 44 Cr) from $66,852 (INR 49 Lakh).\n\nThe saviour for Paytm Mall is speculated to be eBay. It is expected to lead a $160-170 Mn strategic investment as it looks to expand its offline-to-online commerce play in India.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Inc42 Pre-Budget Survey: What India’s Startup Ecosystem Wants From Budget 2020.\n\nWith the economic slowdown, consumer spending decline and the slow GDP growth, there is a lot on the government’s plate as far as the economy is concerned\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the Narendra Modi government in India is about to come up right at the beginning of 2020 with the Union Budget. With the economic slowdown, consumer spending decline and the slow GDP growth, there is a lot on the government’s plate as far finance and the economy is concerned. All eyes are trained on how India and the Modi cabinet will tackle these challenges.\n\nWhile there is speculation about Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman giving tax relief to individuals, the real problem is at the macro level, which might not be solved by such measures. For example, in the previous Union Budget presented on July 05, 2019, the FM announced tax cuts for corporations, but that has not helped the economy pick up pace as seen in the latest GDP figures.\n\nIn the time between the last budget and this one, the government has also looked at divestment of public sector undertakings seriously — but all eyes will be on whether the FM and the cabinet can manage to overturn the slowdown and get growth back on the menu.\n\nContrary to expectations, Sitharaman’s maiden Union Budget bore very little resemblance to the Interim Budget presented by stand-in finance minister Piyush Goyal in February 2019, which was a disappointment for startup industry observers. And the feeling is that the Union Budget 2020 might just change this cold shoulder treatment.\n\nWhile the interim budget in 2019 did not do much to boost the startup ecosystem, with almost negligible provisions for startups, Modi 2.0’s first budget in July this year was littered with startup-friendly measures including a much-awaited clarity on the issue of angel tax — in a spirit similar to the initiatives like the Startup India and the startup-focused Fund of Funds during the first Modi government’s tenure from 2014-2019. This gives hopes to many observers that the Union Budget 2020 would bring in better news for the ecosystem.\n\nAmong other measures, the budget made it clear that India’s target is to become a $3 Tn economy in FY20. To this end, the finance minister said that her primary focus would be on making regulatory changes to kickstart domestic and foreign investment.\n\nTo make India a more desirable FDI destination, Sitharaman said that the government will examine suggestions of further opening up of FDI in aviation, media (animation, AVGC) and insurance sectors in consultation with all stakeholders. In addition, local sourcing norms will be eased for FDI in the single-brand retail sector — a long-running issue for foreign companies like Apple and IKEA.\n\nBut there’s more work to be done to boost the ecosystem. The major concerns range from incentive programmes for electric vehicles and cleantech, both of which are still sunrise sectors despite huge interest. There are also some hurdles when it comes to the growth of the micro, small and medium enterprises in India.\n\nWhile the NBFC crisis of the past two years has damaged the available credit base for MSMEs, the NPAs in the government’s Mudra loans is another worrying factor. Will the government make life easier for these by announcing a new set of reforms to soothe fears in the Budget 2020?\n\nSkill development is another major hurdle, which has blocked the rise of deeptech, healthtech, and robotics and manufacturing sectors. In the Union Budget 2019 in July, Sitharaman also proposed a new education policy which would focus on skill development among technology-intensive sectors such as — AI, robotics and big data analytics. But there hasn’t been much in the way of action on this front either.\n\nWhat Reforms Will Union Budget 2020 Bring?\n\nOne cannot expect reforms to take hold overnight, but soon after the budget announcements, the government has been bouncing from one controversy to another — from economic slowdown to abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir to the most recent highly-controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), which has gripped the nation in fear.\n\nHowever, after a massive victory, the Modi government has a plethora of issues to deal with including a record-high unemployment, deepening economic crisis, and the stand-off with many foreign allies over important trade-related tariffs within the WTO. Given this, Sitharaman will perhaps have very little margin for policies that might not directly address these issues in the next budget.\n\nUnfortunately for startups, this means that startup-friendly policies might not be a major part of the agenda for Sitharaman and the finance ministry. However, with PM Modi harping on about the digital economy, there might be some surprises in store — in the form of higher budget allocation from Startup India’s Fund of Funds or prioritising tax reforms that directly affect the startup ecosystem, it’s time to make your voice heard\n\nIf you are a founder, investor, startup management team or anyhow related to the Indian startup ecosystem, this is your chance to make your voice heard.

No financial terms were disclosed.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nMANAMA, Bahrain, October 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ –Arcapita – a global leader in Shari’ah-compliant alternative investments – has invested in NuYu, a leading chain of women-only boutique gyms in Saudi Arabia.\n\nArcapita’s capital will help NuYu deploy over SAR 250 million ($67 million) to grow its network of boutique gyms from seven to over 30 across the Kingdom. The new centers are expected to create hundreds of jobs, as well as provide women access to fitness outlets in currently underserved locations.\n\nThe investment will enable the company – with five boutique gyms in Riyadh and one each in both Khobar and Dammam – to capitalize on the significant market opportunity arising from a landmark decision by the General Sports Authority to grant licenses for female boutique gyms. This follows recent legislation allowing Saudi women to drive, and to engage in public sporting events. From a base of over 50 facilities nationwide, the female fitness market in Saudi Arabia is expected to grow at an annual rate of 30% over the medium-term.\n\nAtif A. Abdulmalik, Arcapita’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “We look forward to working in partnership with NuYu, helping it realize its full potential during this exciting period of social change. The investment in NuYu is underpinned by robust fundamentals and demonstrates our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of Saudi Arabia’s sport and leisure industry. It is also aligned with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals of empowering women and for citizens to lead healthy and active lifestyles.”\n\n“NuYu is an industry pioneer in Saudi Arabia, with a strong core team that has established a successful operating model. This, coupled with compelling industry dynamics, provides us with an opportunity to generate attractive returns for our investors.”\n\nPrincess Sara Al Saud, NuYu’s Co-founder and Creative Director, said: “We are delighted to partner with Arcapita to guide NuYu’s next chapter of growth. We have been at the forefront of the fitness industry since our establishment with a boutique offering that focuses on high-energy group classes in a welcoming environment. With support from Arcapita, we are excited to be able to accelerate our expansion plans and grow our 6,000-strong membership base. Launching new boutique gyms across the country will make it easier for Saudi women to access fitness and reap the benefits of regular exercise.”\n\nMartin Tan, Arcapita’s Chief Investment Officer, added: “The female fitness segment in Saudi Arabia is virtually untapped with a penetration rate of less than 1%, while having one of the highest revenues per member globally. Given Saudi Arabia’s young and growing population, combined with rising health awareness in the Kingdom, there is significant potential for outsized growth within this highly underserved segment.”\n\nAbout Arcapita\n\nArcapita is a leading alternative investment manager, with offices in Bahrain, Atlanta, London and Singapore.

This round also saw the participation from the Rise Fund managed by TPG Growth.\n\nThe husband-wife duo, Dhimant Parekh and Anuradha Kedia, launched The Better India as an online blog in 2008. The founders registered the company in January 2015 as an online media company, highlighting social and environmental issues, especially faced by the micro, small & medium enterprises (MSME). Four months back, The Better India forayed into the ecommerce vertical.\n\n“We see a huge opportunity to leverage our MSME community who make great products but they lack access to consumers market. We decided to experiment by featuring their products and allowing the community to buy as well, and bring revenue for them,” Parekh told Inc42.\n\nThe startup’s ecommerce vertical is currently at development phase, however, it is accepting orders from cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. The platform currently has over 1,500 products with 150 MSME vendor on board, the founder claimed.\n\n“We plan on catering to the PAN-India MSMEs and deliver their products to consumers from every corner of the country,” Parekh said, adding that it will take a monetisation percentage from every product sold from the platform.\n\nHe, however, said that it’s too early for the startup to determine the monetisation percentage, revenue, etc, as the company’s commerce vertical is in a very early stage.\n\n“The idea is to use the power of content to build a community, mobilise the community for various social causes,” Parekh said.\n\nThe startup claims that over 50 Mn readers have been visiting its platform on a monthly basis. It caters its content across three languages — English, Hindi and Malayalam. With the recently raised funds, it aims to expand its 50-member team in the editorial and marketing departments.\n\nIndia is home to an estimated 5.7 Mn MSMEs as on December 13, 2018, that were registered on the Udyog Aadhaar (UA) portal. In a bid to uplift the sector, Microsoft recently launched a similar online ecommerce platform, named weave.in, as part of the company’s philanthropic initiative, Project ReWeave.\n\nThe platform sells an array of handloom products created by the weaver communities of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The company also provides these communities with computer design training in their digital empowerment centres.\n\nOn the other hand, large ecommerce corporates such as Amazon India and Flipkart are also betting big on the country’s MSME sector. While Amazon India added handloom and handicraft items of Weavesmart, an online government handloom store, on its platform, Flipkart’s Myntra has partnered with the Textile Ministry and launched ‘Navibhu’, a private label handloom brand.", "entities": [[0, 16, "org_in_focus"], [24, 31, "money_funded"], [35, 43, "type_of_funding"], [87, 103, "org_in_focus"], [194, 203, "headquarters_loc"], [216, 221, "money_funded"], [223, 230, "money_funded"], [235, 243, "type_of_funding"], [280, 293, "investor"], [419, 429, "investor"], [498, 514, "org_in_focus"], [536, 540, "year_founded"], [589, 593, "year_founded"]]}

The startup was founded in 2017 by Ziad El Adawy, Yara Yehia, Sameh Saleh, Hatem Ayoub and Mohamed Mostafa.\n\nThe round was led by 500 Startups through its 500 Falcons Middle East and North Africa (MENA) focused fund with the participation of angel investor Jamal El Dabal and Innoventures.\n\nTripdizer was founded in 2017 and was part of 500 Startup’s MENA Dojo accelerator\n\nEl Adawy responding to questions last Friday (8 November) said the round — which includes $150 000 the startup raised from 500 Startups as part of its participation in the third cohort of the VC’s MENA Dojo accelerator — was concluded in August.\n\n“This is the total amount of funding we have officially raised aside from money that were put in by the founders in the beginning,” pointed out El Adawy.\n\nEl Adawy said Tripdizer’s revenues and users have been growing. Without disclosing any figures, he said the startup has tripled the revenue it generated last year and plans to release a new product next month that he expects will increase sales next year.\n\nTripdizer sees Africa as an important market and has plans to expand on the continent. El Adawy explained that this is because more people on the continent are travelling abroad as their incomes rise.\n\nAfrica, he added, is becoming one of the “hot travel destinations” and inbound travel will serve the continent well.\n\n“We will also be expanding in the MENA region, as it is the fastest growing market for outbound travels in the world and technology adoption is high, our product fits perfectly for both regions and we want to be at the forefront of the travel industry in both regions,” he said.\n\n‘Significant growth in MENA online travel market’\n\nSharif El-Badawi, 500 Startups MENA managing partner, said in an earlier statement that the MENA region has seen “significant growth” in the online travel market.\n\nHe attributed this to tech savvy consumers who are now looking for an overall travel booking experience where they want to plan and book their accommodation, tickets, tours and activities all on one common platform.\n\nEl-Badawi said in such a market Tripdizer is “strategically positioned” to change complicated and intricate travel plans into an exciting, comfortable and memorable travel experience.\n\n“Tripdizer has been growing steadily at 30% month-on-month, successfully increasing the customer base to thousands of travelers.\n\n“We are pleased to have led this funding round and look forward to working closely with this remarkable team as they advance to the forefront of the travel industry,” said El-Badawi.\n\nTripdizer was earlier this year recognised by the UN World Trade Organisation (UNWTO) and the Egyptian tourism ministry as one of the most innovative travel startups in the region.\n\nFeatured image: Tripdizer team (Supplied)", "entities": []}

The investment was led by Trilogy Equity Partners, alongside Two Sigma Ventures, Founders Co-Op, Fathom Capital, Techstars Ventures and angel investors. The New York City-based company came out of the Amazon Alexa Accelerator program, powered by TechStars, and was created in partnership with Amazon's Alexa fund in fall 2017.\n\n\n\nYuval Neeman, Partner at Trilogy Equity Partners who previously led Microsoft's Developer division, will join Comet.ml's Board of Directors and Matt Jacobus, Two Sigma's Former CTO and a Venture Partner at Two Sigma Ventures, will join as a board observer. Comet.ml will use the financing to expand its team of software engineers and data scientists to continue to develop its product.\n\n\n\nComet.ml is the first platform built for ML that enables engineers and data scientists to efficiently maintain their preferred workflow and tools, while easily tracking previous work and collaborate throughout the iterative process. Comet.ml also optimizes models with bayesian hyperparameter optimization - a type of algorithm - which saves time typically spent on manual tuning ML models. As a result, users have increased visibility of data science and ML results and progress throughout an organization.\n\n\n\nMachine learning is rapidly gaining traction as a powerful tool within organizations, and executives recognize that using ML to power artificial intelligence will be a key competitive advantage. However, most companies quickly realize that extracting value from ML teams can be challenging.\n\n\n\n\"Machine learning sits between software engineering and business intelligence, and as such requires different processes and methodologies - in software engineering, code is everything,\" said Gideon Mendels, Founder and CEO of Comet.ml. \"However, in machine learning, code is just a small part of the process, as teams need to maintain more complex workflows, including datasets and models. This is where Comet.ml comes in - we optimize the machine learning process by providing the software that works with a customer's existing infrastructure, and gives developers better machine learning models.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike other platforms, Comet.ml manages and monitors customers' existing systems and infrastructure (e.g., existing code, databases, software and servers) instead of requiring customers to migrate their existing codebase, datasets and DevOps tools. Within 15 seconds and one line of code customers get started on Comet.ml. To date, data scientists from 30+ leading industry companies and universities have developed over 6,000 ML models on the Comet.ml platform.\n\n\n\n\"At Trilogy, we look for exceptional founders seeking to solve a fundamental problem and from the first meeting with Gideon and Nimrod, we were struck by how smart, creative and pragmatic they were,\" said Yuval Neeman, Partner at Trilogy Equity Partners s. \"Data scientist and machine learning practitioners, while using a very different workflow than coding, still need tools similar to Github, Atlassian suite or Microsoft's Visual Studio. We think enterprise customers will want to invest in making their hardest-to-find and highest-paid researchers more productive. We believe Comet.ml's novel approach makes it a compelling product.\"\n\n\n\nThe Comet.ml founding team, led by Gideon Mendels and Nimrod Lahav, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, previously worked in ML at Google and Wix.com. In their previous roles, they noticed many teams revert to emails and homebrewed solutions to manage their ML workflows; they recognized the need for a platform to help ML maintain complex datasets, parameters, experiments, and trained models.\n\n\n\n\"When our team saw that adding a single line of code could give us real-time metrics and charts detailing how our models converged while saving our experiments, we realized how quickly Comet.ml could accelerate the modeling process and catch on,\" said Matt Jacobus, Venture Partner, Two Sigma Ventures. \"Every time you run an experiment, Comet.ml snapshots your model code, parameters, code, configuration, and tracks it, allowing data scientists to visualize and organize their work at virtually no cost.\"\n\n\n\nComet.ml provides free and unlimited access to its platform for open source projects and academia to encourage reproducibility and knowledge sharing within the ML community.\n\n\n\nAbout Comet.ml\n\nComet.ml is the first infrastructure-agnostic machine learning (ML) platform that allows ML and data science teams to automatically track datasets, code changes, experimentation history and production models, creating efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility. Based in New York City, Comet.ml supercharges machine learning teams, helping them build better ML models and improve productivity.", "entities": [[0, 8, "org_in_focus"], [14, 19, "money_funded"], [20, 24, "type_of_funding"], [43, 55, "headquarters_loc"], [57, 65, "org_in_focus"], [66, 71, "date_of_funding"], [126, 138, "money_funded"], [142, 146, "type_of_funding"], [319, 327, "org_in_focus"], [474, 479, "date_of_funding"], [534, 546, "money_funded"], [550, 554, "type_of_funding"], [590, 613, "investor"], [625, 643, "investor"], [645, 659, "investor"], [661, 675, "investor"], [677, 695, "investor"], [700, 715, "investor"], [721, 729, "headquarters_loc"], [885, 889, "year_founded"], [5179, 5187, "headquarters_loc"], [5194, 5202, "org_in_focus"]]}

{"text": "Most startup founders fear the tech industry is in a bubble, survey finds.\n\nOver the past two years there’s been a lot of talk regarding “unicorns”, or startups carrying US$1-billion valuations.

Specifically, industries such as wearables and bitcoin are believed to be overhyped, while autonomous vehicles and mobile are underhyped.\n\nProspects for the VC industry overall don’t seem that positive either, with over 95% thinking that it’s going to remain the same or get harder to raise capital.\n\nInterestingly, enterprise company founders are very optimistic. Firstly, this group denies the bubble twice as often as its consumer company peers. Secondly, twice as many founders who fall into the former category also indicate that they’ll be profitable within the next year.\n\nOther interesting findings by First Round include the fact that 44% of women-led companies have a 50/50 gender ratio, while only 25% of men-led companies do. Women-led companies are also more likely to have some initiative in place to increase diversity.\n\nRead more: Ventureburn survey sheds light on SA’s tough, but pioneering startup industry\n\nThe biggest concern for VC-backed entrepreneurs, according to the survey, is finding and hiring the best talent. This is followed by concerns over revenue growth, acquiring customers, culture, raising follow-on capital, and so forth.\n\nFirst Round also found that founders over the ages of 30 are 40% more likely to be solo founders than their younger peers. And that while younger entrepreneurs (under 30-years old) are more likely to have a “strained” relationship with their co-founders, they tend to be best friends — over 33% more likely than their older peers.\n\nOut of the 611 entries for the “most admired leader in technology”, a massive 22% voted for Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He was followed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (7.5%), Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (3.3%) and Google co-founder Larry Page (2.6%). Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was the most popular woman submitted with only 0.7% of the vote.\n\nSee the Slideshare below:\n\nImage by Ferran Jordà via Flickr", "entities": []}

The fresh capital will support Veridu in further developing and rolling out their solutions globally.\n\nVeridu was founded in 2012 with the goal to end the uncertainty of online merchants over whether to trust certain high risk transactions. The startup aims to provide the most accurate, reliable and trustworthy tool to quickly and efficiently verify the identity of users in order to eliminate fraud and unwanted user behavior.\n\nRasmus Groth, CEO and founder of Veridu stated: “Veridu was established to bring trust to the internet and eliminate the identity verification challenge by harnessing the widespread adoption of social media, and using this wealth of information on an individual as a form of identity. Now that Worldpay has invested in us, we’ll work closely with them to further strengthen our product and make sure that it meets all the needs that payments processors and their customers have in today’s economy,”\n\nBy using advanced algorithms and people’s social media profiles, Veridu is able to score how trustworthy the identity of a person is. With the user’s consent, the information is then shared with the company who has asked to establish trust in their identity, such as a sharing economy platform or online store. This innovative method of bringing trust to online transactions has made several investors and venture capitalists invest in Veridu, and now Worldpay has joined this investor group.\n\nAs consumer bases become more international, many online businesses struggle with false positives — wrongly declining legitimate transactions – as the methods they use to verify identity in their home markets may not work in all countries. The ability to comprehensively verify the identities of potential customers globally, therefore, has a direct impact on their revenues.\n\nRon Kalifa, Vice Chairman, Worldpay said, “By verifying shoppers via their digital identity, Veridu’s technology delivers an additional level of security for higher risk transactions. By partnering with this innovative startup, Worldpay will be able to offer our customers yet another way to protect their business from online fraud.”\n\nThe recent investment from Worldpay is undisclosed.

{"text": "Lessons learned from Angel Investor Bootcamp in South Africa.\n\nOn 27 August the third session in a series of Angel Investor Bootcamps leading up to the ABAN Investor Summit at DEMO Africa was hosted in Cape Town. The Bootcamps are organised by the African Business Angel Network (ABAN) in partnership with VC4Africa, Intercontinental Trust and the LIONS Africa Partnership. The Cape Town edition was hosted together with the Silicon Cape Initiative.\n\nAlexandra Fraser, past-chairperson of Silicon Cape, welcomed an audience of angels, entrepreneurs and potential investors who were there to learn more, share experiences and to network with each other. “Angel investing is never just about the money” said Fraser. “It’s about bringing mentorship, experience, expertise and an established network of contacts to the relationship.”\n\nFraser introduced FNB Cape Provincial Head, Stephan Claassen who emphasised the need for entrepreneurial growth in South Africa. “South Africa needs entrepreneurship and FNB is committed to supporting entrepreneurial development,” said Claassen. He added:\n\nWe wanted to be part of creating this platform with Silicon Cape. We like innovative business. It’s an opportunity for us to attract new business and to invest in innovation. We have clients who are looking to invest so it’s relevant to our current clients’ needs.\n\nABAN’s objective is to promote a culture of early stage investing across Africa. “The concept behind our Masterclasses like this, is that we’re able to have conversations with, and learn from the local community,” said David van Dijk, ABAN’s co-founder and director. “We’ll take the lessons learned to an annual summit taking place on 23 September 2015 in Lagos, Nigeria”.\n\nRead more: Lessons learned on building a pan-African network of angel investors\n\nVan Dijk introduced keynote speaker, Selma Prodanovic, also known as the Business Angelina or Startup-Grand-Dame. Prodanovic is a co-founder of the Austrian Angel Investors Association, board member of the European Business Angels Network (EBAN), and founder of Brainswork. Prodanovic describes herself as an ‘absolutely passionate entrepreneur’.\n\n“I believe entrepreneurs and startups are the ones who creating solutions to problems. And we need to help and support them,” Prodanovic said.\n\nHaving attended a panel discussion at the SA Innovation Summit earlier in the day, Prodanovic realised that many of the challenges that local South African entrepreneurs are facing are in fact, global issues, such as the need for education and infrastructure.\n\n“But then, what are entrepreneurs? Entrepreneurs create what they want to create, against all odds and no matter what,” she said. “At the end of the day, if it was easy, then everybody would do it.”\n\n“A business angel means more than just cash-in-cash-out investing. They’re bringing much more to a startup,” said Prodanovic.\n\nShe explained that business angels bring three types of capital to a venture. Financial capital (cash); social capital (a network of high-level contacts) and human capital (knowledge and experience).\n\nBeing a business angel is a fantastic thing to do. You’re able to enable entrepreneurs to follow and build their dreams. But it’s important to think about why you are a business angel. If for example you are in New York, you will say you’re in the exit business. It’s all about making money at the end of the day. But I totally disagree. The exit is a result, but not the main purpose. I think that business angels are in the business of creating great businesses.\n\nProdanovic urged the audience to think of themselves as potential business angels. “It’s not about investing huge amounts of money.”\n\nAlso, Prodanovic would like to see more corporate CEOs becoming angel investors: “They have the expertise, the networks and relationships with international corporates, so they can facilitate international relations and open doors for startups, which makes it much easier for the startups to grow.”\n\nShe elaborated:\n\nWe need a diversity of business angels to be enable a diversity of startups. Globally, women are under-represented in the startup space. And we’ve got to change that. The Rising Tide is a global fund and training program created by 99 women angel investors with the objective of increasing women’s participation in angel investing and educating a new wave of angel investors. It’s not about investing as a female. It’s about having female investors, which in turn encourages more female founders to enter the start-up space.\n\nRead more: 7 things you need to know about pitching to South African angel investors\n\nFollowing the keynote, a panel discussion on angel investment took place. Facilitated by Fraser, it featured panellists Prodanovic and investors Daniel Guasco of Team Africa Ventures, Justin Stanford of 4Di Capital, Ernst Hertzog of Action Hero Ventures and Willem du Preez of Intercontinental Trust.\n\nThe panel agreed that it’s crucial that both angels and founders are aligned with similar values, expectations and a common end goal. That alignment needs to be outlined in the terms, because if there is not alignment, it can lead to expectations not being met, and that can cause a venture to derail. The panellists addressed the importance of encouraging corporate executives to become angel investors. “In my experience, there is a lot of capital available,” said Hertzog. He added:\n\nBut the problem is to get executives to donate their time. And that’s what you’re after. There’s no point making this type of investment if you’re not involved. They need to find the time to add value to their investment portfolio.\n\nStanford advises entrepreneurs to prioritise what they need from angels according to their strengths and to ask for targeted advice addressing specific queries, rather than to expect what he called an all-encompassing flow of feedback from the angels. He believes that one of the biggest errors you can make as an investor is to make decisions for the management team.\n\n“You can make suggestions,” Hertzog said. “But management must always own the outcomes. Make sure you’re giving advice and not instruction.”\n\nAngel investing is not about overnight success and is high-risk. It can take up to ten years to build a sustainable and successful venture and it usually requires a lot more investment than initially planned for.\n\n“Investors need to be aware that the first cheque is never the last cheque. When you make an investment, you buy the obligation to put more money in,” said Stanford. “Usually it makes half the revenue and takes double the cost and double the time,” he said.\n\nProdanovic is committed to increasing the visibility of angel investing and start-ups and initiated the one million startups campaign to extend this awareness:\n\nWe’re still in the minority and we need to create awareness in the outside world. The majority of people do not realise the importance of startups in terms of the solutions they offer. Big corporates are no longer able to create jobs and are mostly not creating innovation, whereas entrepreneurs and startups are able to create and deliver innovation in a much faster turnaround time.\n\n“The world needs to recognise that startups are an important part of the solution to our problems.” she said. “Anyone can become an angel investor. It’s the best way to make a better tomorrow.”\n\nThis article by Bettina Moss first appeared on VC4Africa, a Burn Media publishing partner. Photos by Hannes Thiart.", "entities": []}

The company plans to use the funding to hire more AI specialists and ramp up its brand marketing efforts.\n\nThe startup’s idea is to become a one-stop-shop for menswear by combining human stylists with AI algorithms to help customers choose what clothes to buy. When registering in the service, the users are asked a series of question about their style and clothes they like. Thread has partnered with over 50 brands so far, including Barbour, Hugo Boss, and Levis.\n\n“More than ever, guys care about dressing well, which is why menswear is a growing market,” said Kieran O’Neill, CEO and co-founder of Thread. “But they face an overwhelming number of options on the High Street and online. We’re used to having digital services such as Uber, Netflix, and Spotify simplify other aspects of our lives, and men are now turning to Thread as their go-to solution for dressing well. As our stylists and algorithms learn more about our customers, we’ve brought on a huge number of new brands to help each of our customers find the perfect clothes for them.”\n\nThe company, which employs around 100 people, now has over a million users. Thread also stated that a quarter of all its customers now do all their clothes shopping on the platform. The average customer of the startup is in their late twenties to early forties.\n\nThe company has raised more than $40 million in funding so far.

{"text": "Real Ventures Fund III Gets First Close at $50 Million.\n\nIt came with a lot of talk leading up to it, but this morning Montreal-based venture capital firm Real Ventures officially confirmed the first close of its new, third fund. The first close is worth $50 million, and the fund is expected to reach $100 million before its final close.\n\nNeedless to say, this is extremely positive news for both Real Ventures’ stomping ground Montreal, as well as the rest of Canada. The firm said a significant portion of the first close will be earmarked for Quebec companies, but it’s safe to expect an increased presence in the Toronto-Waterloo corridor eventually.\n\n“Real” is Canada’s largest and most active seed venture capital fund manager and driving force behind startup accelerator FounderFuel and downtown tech innovation hub Notman House.\n\nThe lead investors in the new fund are Québec based Teralys Capital, FIER Partenaires L.P. and the Business Development Bank of Canada for Government of Canada, via its Venture Capital Action Plan (VCAP). Participating alongside are a select number of family offices and individuals, in addition to Real Ventures’ General Partners.\n\nThis is Real Ventures’ third fund since its creation in 2007. “Real III”, as with previous funds, will be invested in entrepreneur-driven companies that are building “the Internet experiences of the future or that are using the power of the Internet to transform industries,” as the company wrote.\n\nSince 2008 Real Ventures has invested in over 60 startups, and was the initial investor in Canadian startups like Beyond the Rack, Frank & Oak, Cinemagram, OM Signal, Uniiverse and Unbounce. According to data from Thomson Reuters, Real Ventures was the number one private VC investor in Canada in terms of seed-stage investments in 2013. It made 16 investments during the year and exited two portfolio companies, including video streaming platform 5by, which was sold to StumbleUpon in September.\n\nFor Teralys Capital, the Montreal-based “fund of funds”, Real’s new fund will be the 17th time Teralys has invested in a sector-focused fund. “This new investment is consistent with Teralys Capital’s strategy aimed at building a strong venture capital ecosystem that propels high-potential innovative companies in Quebec,” says Éric Legault, Managing Partner at Teralys Capital.\n\nA portion of the first close of the new fund is also coming from the federal government’s VCAP program. In September the government of Canada invested $10 million in Real, as well as investments into three other Canadian VC funds.\n\n“In contributing to this investment through Canada’s Venture Capital Action Plan, the Government of Canada recognizes that our innovative firms are important drivers in creating economic growth, high quality jobs and long-term prosperity,” said Canada’s Finance Minister Joe Oliver. “We believe that Canada’s entrepreneurs represent superior opportunities for investors, and understand that private-sector led investments and decision-making are essential to their long-term success.”", "entities": []}

Building on the pioneering work of world-renowned experts at the University of Maryland and Duke University, IonQ plans to bring general-purpose quantum computers to market by late 2018.\n\n\n\n\"Efforts to harness quantum mechanics to accelerate computation have gained tremendous momentum in recent years, fueled by significant scientific progress and growing interest -- and investment -- by some of the world's largest governments, organizations and technology companies,\" said David Moehring, PhD, CEO of IonQ. \"While there is much yet to be discovered about specific applications, there is a massive market clamoring for practical quantum computers. Building on the groundbreaking work of Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim, IonQ's mission is to make reliable, scalable quantum computing a reality.\"\n\n\n\nIonQ's team comprises some of the world's foremost experts in the field of quantum computing. Co-founders Chris Monroe of University of Maryland and Jungsang Kim of Duke University are longtime collaborators, well-known for their pioneering work in ion-trap experiments. Ion trapping is the hallmark of IonQ's approach and a key differentiator from other efforts underway. Moehring, who joined as CEO in 2016, was most recently at U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), charged with oversight of government-sponsored quantum computing initiatives.\n\n\n\n\"There is simply no team in the world with more expertise in trapped ion technology, or with greater understanding of the broader quantum computing landscape,\" said Ron Bernal, Venture Partner at NEA and a member of IonQ's board of directors. \"We are incredibly excited to partner with Dave, Chris and Jungsang as they advance the field of quantum computing and develop a platform for its commercial applications.\"\n\n\n\nIonQ's trapped ions represent one of multiple approaches being explored to power a quantum computer. Most large technology companies initiating quantum computing research attempt to leverage their core semiconductor technology by developing superconducting qubits. IonQ believes trapped ion technology, which uses lasers to cool and isolate individual ions, will prevail because trapped ions are identical, more stable, can be better controlled, and are therefore likely to scale with better performance and greater predictability.\n\n\n\n\"Quantum computers are the next giant leap in the ability to process information, and IonQ's promising approach builds on nearly two decades of research by highly regarded physicists and engineers in the field,\" said Blake Byers, General Partner at GV and a member of IonQ's board of directors. \"Quantum computers have the potential to solve data-intensive problems in areas like healthcare, machine learning, and cryptography, and we're excited to partner with IonQ as it accelerates development.\"\n\n\n\nIonQ has raised approximately $22 million in total, with an earlier $2 million invested by NEA in 2016. The company has demonstrated significant momentum over the last year, adding several new board members and strategic advisors, expanding its product development team, and attracting growing interest from both the scientific and startup communities. In addition to Bernal and Byers, new board members include Jeong Kim, former president of Bell Labs, and Andrew Schoen, Principal at NEA. John Preskill, the Director of the Institute for Quantum Information at Caltech, and Jagdeep Singh, founder and CEO of QuantumScape, Lightera Networks, and Infinera, are serving as advisors to the company.\n\n\n\nAbout IonQ\n\n\n\nIonQ is developing world-leading general-purpose quantum information processors. Our unique trapped ion approach combines unmatched physical performance, perfect qubit replication, optical networkability, and highly-optimized algorithms to create a quantum computer that is as scalable as it is powerful, and that will support a broad array of applications across a variety of industries. IonQ is headquartered in College Park, MD and backed by New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and GV (formerly Google Ventures). Co-founders Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim are leading experts in the field of trapped-ion quantum computing. Professors Monroe and Kim also maintain large academic research groups at the University of Maryland and Duke University, respectively, with a combined government funding of roughly $10M per year. This pioneering work is the cornerstone of IonQ's uniquely scalable technology.\n\n\n\nAbout Quantum Computing\n\n\n\nQuantum computing represents a radical departure from classical computing and has the potential to overcome these limitations by embracing uniquely quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, that emerge at atomic scale. Quantum computers' ability to perform incredibly complex calculations and data processing exponentially faster than classical computers opens up a world of possible commercial and scientific applications. The potential is staggering, and though we are still in the early days of quantum computing, we anticipate that the technology will transform industries and facilitate breakthroughs in areas as disparate as machine learning, molecular interaction simulation, cryptography, financial analysis, logistics optimization, and big data search.", "entities": [[0, 4, "org_in_focus"], [15, 19, "money_funded"], [20, 28, "type_of_funding"], [43, 59, "headquarters_loc"], [61, 65, "org_in_focus"], [148, 153, "date_of_funding"], [180, 191, "money_funded"], [192, 200, "type_of_funding"], [380, 405, "investor"], [416, 418, "investor"], [3325, 3329, "org_in_focus"], [3355, 3366, "cumulative"], [4428, 4432, "org_in_focus"], [4453, 4469, "headquarters_loc"], [4484, 4509, "investor"], [4520, 4522, "investor"]]}

The campaign reached a million dollars in less than 20 minutes, and continued to raise money at an alarming rate for a week straight. Following this morning’s announcement of the Pebble Time Steel, The Verge reports that the Pebble Time campaign has become the most successful Kickstarter campaign ever.\n\nThis morning we reported that the campaign had already received $12 million in funding. Today’s addition of a Steel option and announcement of a new Smartstraps program has added another million dollars to the campaign. At time of writing, the campaign had already received more than $13.6 million in funding from close to 60,000 backers.\n\nThe Verge reminds us that number one most funded Kickstart project was last year’s Coolest Cooler. It received $13,285,226 in funding despite its $50,000 goal thanks to commitments from 62,642 backers. The Coolest Cooler has now been bumped and sits at number two, sandwiched between the original Pebble and the upcoming Pebble Time.\n\nWith 24 days to go, the Pebble Time’s funding will likely hit $20 million before the campaign expires.

The injection of capital will be used to bring Mirakl’s online marketplace platform to a greater number of B2C and B2B retailers across the globe.\n\nThe deal was led by 83North‘s Laurel Bowden (an investor in firms such as hybris, Just Eat and Notonthehighstreet), Felix Capital‘s Frederic Court and Dave Strohm, Partner at Greylock and a founding investor and advisor to 83North. The funding comes on the back of Mirakl achieving growth of 200% between 2013 and 2014 and signing 22 new customers so far in 2015.\n\nThe round, one of the largest secured by a French firm this year, will drive Mirakl’s international expansion. Following the 2014 opening of its first American office, the U.S. will continue to be a key growth market. Mirakl’s current B2C customers include Best Buy, GAME, Halfords, Woolworths, Galeries Lafayette and Darty, and in total Mirakl has 55 customers across 11 countries.\n\nAccording to IDC the SaaS enterprise applications market is forecast to increase to a total of USD $50.8 billion by 2018. At the same time Statista projects retail ecommerce to grow to USD $2.39 trillion by 2018.\n\n“Any smart retailer in 2015 should have an online marketplace, or be considering it as an option,” said Adrien Nussenbaum, co-founder and U.S. CEO, Mirakl. “Consumers want choice, service and competitive pricing and an online marketplace delivers all three, allowing controlled growth and the on-going improvement and refinement of the customer experience. It doesn’t matter if your business model is B2C or B2B, an online marketplace will help you reach and service customers better than ever before.”\n\nLaurel Bowden, Partner, 83North said: “Online marketplaces are everywhere, driving multichannel retail and offering a greater scope for expansion combined with higher profit growth and lower risk. We are getting ever closer to a time where every sector, be it art, professional services or travel, will be utilising online marketplaces and Mirakl is well positioned to deliver this. I’m excited to begin working alongside the exceptional entrepreneurial team that has already built Mirakl to where it is today.”\n\nPhilippe Corrot, co-founder and CEO, Mirakl commented: “Mirakl is growing incredibly fast and attracting such a range of world-class investors will be a major benefit to us as we continue our journey. Global commerce is continuously increasing in competitiveness, and those who adapt to changing consumption patterns and place customers at the heart of their business succeed. With this investment we can capitalise on our market leading position in Europe and achieve the same success supporting the most dynamic B2C and B2B online marketplaces across the USA.”\n\nMirakl is headquartered in Paris and also has offices in London and Boston.

{"text": "Section 12J VC incentive a good start, but government can do more [Opinion].\n\nThe world of startups is a risky choice for an investor. But there is a clever way you can reduce that risk, and that is by investing in a government-sanctioned Section 12J fund.\n\nThe tech industry often laments that government can do more to support small business. Yes, it can do more, but here is an example where it is making a difference.\n\nSection 12J funds have been around for the past 10 years but have only gained traction in the startup world recently. The attractive part about these funds are that they are 100% tax deductible should one hold the investment for five years or longer.\n\nTherefore, if a taxpayer is an individual or a trust with a marginal tax rate of 45%, the taxpayer can invest R1-million and will only pay R550 000 (that is R1 million minus tax of R450 000) for the investment.\n\nIn simple terms it means your startup investment comes in at about half the price. For companies that invest, the principle is the same, but the calculation looks different because companies are taxed at 28%.\n\nIf you are in the top tax bracket, it’s an attractive option for investors with higher risk appetites, especially those who have already maxed out their retirement annuity, pension fund and tax-free savings account contributions.\n\nGiven the country’s priority on small business and job creation, it’s simply a no-brainer that Section 12J should continue, be improved, and be intensified\n\nThere is a catch though. When you realise the investment after five years, the base for the capital gain will be zero due to the initial tax benefit received. Effectively the government will recoup some of its tax when you exit the fund, but still, the overall benefit is there.\n\nCEO of Kalon Venture Partners Clive Butkow says that government introduced Section 12Js to solve the key issue that all small and medium-sized businesses have: access to equity finance.\n\nKalon is one of the few dedicated tech and startup Section 12J Venture Capital Companies (VCCs) out of the 130 or so that have now been registered.\n\nWhen Kalon registered as a Section 12J, it was fund number 30. Just three years later 100 more funds rushed online – a sign that investors are waking up to this opportunity. The majority of funds look at areas such as mining, hospitality, renewable energy, student accommodation, moveable assets, and others.\n\n\n\n‘Investing in disruptive tech’\n\nButkow’s VCC invests exclusively in “disruptive digital technology” and claims to have raised in excess of R100-million. He says his fund has so far invested in four tech companies, with additional deals in the pipeline.\n\n“The VCC is intended to be a marketing vehicle that will attract retail investors. It has the benefit of bringing together fund managers concentrating investment expertise in favour of the small business sector,” he says.\n\nKalon caters for both the small investor with a minimum investment amount of R110 000 but also includes big-money investors too.\n\n\n\nThree of Kalon’s investments involve an EFT payments platform, a loyalty programme and an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot.\n\nI-Pay is its EFT payments platform where consumers can use EFT rather than a credit card when making purchases online or at the point of sale. Butkow says these transactions are cheaper and more secure than credit cards, and enables consumers who do not have a credit card to transact online.\n\nTheir AI play, FinChatBot, is chatbot that helps companies reduce customer acquisition costs through a conversational bot. The company also enables companies to reduce the size of their call centres for certain transactions.\n\nOn the loyalty side, Butkow claims that SnapnSave is “South Africa’s number one cash-back shopping app”. The app gives shoppers money back on everyday items they buy.\n\nSnapnSave does not require integration to the retailers’ point of sale and allows consumers to purchase discounted products in any retail store, snap their till slip and receive money back in their bank accounts.\n\nGood start, but state can do more\n\nSection 12Js are a good start, but government can do much more if it wants to become part of the tech and startup wave that is gripping the world. A good start would be to create a fund that caters particularly towards tech startups.\n\nButkow says that Section 12J’s tech-focused VCCs have certain limitations, such as the time horizon to investment.\n\nHe says that typically a tech fund invests in about “one out of every 100 companies” and needs longer than the Section 12J-legislated three years to deploy all its capital responsibly.\n\nThere is also confusion over whether fintech and insurtech companies are seen as qualifying companies because S12Js specifically exclude “financial service, insurance and banking companies”. Butkow argues that these startups are tech companies and not financial services companies.\n\nGovernment could get more creative and use the Section 12J or a variant to start attracting sorely needed tech talent into the country.\n\nFor example, many countries allow residency or citizenship based on the startup investments they make.\n\nIn 2021 the S12J regime comes to an end. The government will then assess if it has achieved its objective of creating jobs or not.\n\n\n\nGiven the country’s priority on small business and job creation, it’s simply a no-brainer that Section 12J should continue, be improved, and be intensified.\n\nMore on Section 12J funds\n\nWhat investors should look for in a Section 12J VC company [Opinion]\n\nState must close door on those that misuse VC tax incentive [Opinion]\n\nSavca raises concern over governance issues in Section 12J VC tax incentive\n\nVenture capitalists welcome Section 12J proposals but call for more changes\n\nInvestors clamouring for 12J VC incentive following tax hike – fund managers\n\nCan 12J VC tax incentive create the jobs South Africa badly needs?\n\nForeign investment injection could propel South Africa’s VC ecosystem, 12J funds\n\nMore from Matthew Buckland\n\nHow corporates are jumping to work with tech startups [Opinion]\n\nYour pitch deck is your business story, but don’t let it baffle investors [Opinion]\n\nHow Naspers could help find SA’s next great tech startups [Opinion]\n\nPick a sector, add internet and your firm could be worth millions [Opinion]\n\nTime for startups to get over myth of the ‘one big idea’ and just get going [Opinion]\n\nWhat really is the secret to getting a VC deal?

Charlie Moret, who ran Connecticut’s Pre-Seed Fund, CTech and TechStart before joining TechTown Detroit in 2012, recently left TechTown to start Invest Michigan, where he serves as president and CEO.\n\nThe $6.8 million for the fund comes from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), the state’s lead advocate for economic growth. Paula Sorrell, MEDC vice president of Entrepreneurship & Innovation, will participate on the Invest Michigan board as an observer. As it has done with its other tech-targeted funding programs, the MEDC wants to leverage at least $8 in private investment for every MSF dollar invested.\n\n“These pre-seed funds are intended to help innovative companies take those last steps to become commercially viable and more attractive to private investors,” Sorrell said. “With the wealth of entrepreneurial talent we have in Michigan, we want to make sure good ideas turn into businesses that help expand and strengthen the state economy.”\n\nIn addition to Moret, Invest Michigan board members include:\n\nMark J.

{"text": "London-based Taster scores €7 million Series A to scale its delivery-only restaurant brands.\n\nThe online food delivery space has seen enormous growth in recent years and has driven the success of some of the biggest names in tech today, from on-demand delivery services to kitchen operators. Digital food brands devised from the ground up for food delivery and optimized through technological innovations are the next frontier for the online food delivery market, which is expected to be worth €320 billion by 2030.\n\nFounded in 2017, London-based Taster is creating a range of delivery-only online restaurant brands. The startup has raised €7 million in Series A investment from Battery Ventures, Heartcore Capital, LocalGlobe, Marc Ménasé, and other existing investors.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Anton Soulier, one of the first employees at Deliveroo, Taster creates and operates online restaurant brands available through on-demand food delivery platforms. The company is experiencing 30% month-on-month growth, and currently operates three different restaurant brands across London, Paris, and Madrid. Taster already has a team of 115 employees, of which 100 are chefs, and has served over 400,000 meals to date.\n\nTaster’s rapid growth is due to the success of its three delivery-only restaurants: Mission Saigon, O Ke Kai, and Out-Fry. Each was devised in partnership with renowned chefs, one of whom holds two Michelin stars, and each offers a unique menu, quality ingredients, rapid service, and food made for delivery. The restaurants deliver their meals through popular food delivery services like Deliveroo, UberEATS and Glovo, and prepare meals in local kitchens designed for food delivery.\n\nTaster has developed a host of technological innovations to help rapidly deploy its restaurants in new areas, seamlessly integrate across delivery platforms, and automate supply chain and billings, including an algorithm that accurately predicts the right amount of ingredients to order and prepare for each of their restaurants’ dishes on a daily basis – drastically reducing food waste and ensuring efficiency.\n\n“Since launching Taster just two years ago, we have been bowled over by the incredible reception our restaurants have received; this is testament to the passion and expertise our chefs bring to our kitchens every day, the huge consumer demand for quality food devised and crafted especially for on-demand delivery, and the benefits of a hyper-local business model,” said Taster CEO and founder Anton Soulier. “Delivery platforms are fast becoming the new high street, and the infrastructure is now in place for food to go online; with Taster, we want to build iconic restaurant brands for this new era.\n\n“We couldn’t be happier to welcome a host of impressive investors with our funding, which will help us reach more people across the UK, France and Spain, launch exciting new restaurant brands, and double down on our technology offering.”\n\nThe new investment will be used to recruit talent across tech and engineering, supply chain and marketing, and to develop new technologies. Taster plans to launch three new online restaurant brands by the end of the year, and will also be expanding its coverage across the entirety of Paris, London, and Madrid by the end of 2019.\n\n“The on-demand economy is revolutionizing multiple industries, and restaurants are at the forefront of this trend,” said Scott Tobin, general partner at Battery Ventures. “The team at Taster is staking out a new frontier in food delivery, leveraging cutting-edge technology and posting impressive traction to date with its three strong, delivery-only brands. We are delighted to be partnering with Anton and his team as Taster continues to expand its offering and international presence.”", "entities": [[0, 6, "headquarters_loc"], [13, 19, "org_in_focus"], [27, 37, "money_funded"], [38, 46, "type_of_funding"], [528, 532, "year_founded"], [534, 540, "headquarters_loc"], [640, 650, "money_funded"], [654, 662, "type_of_funding"], [679, 695, "investor"], [697, 714, "investor"], [716, 726, "investor"], [728, 739, "investor"], [783, 787, "year_founded"], [847, 853, "org_in_focus"]]}

{"text": "Bold Commerce raises $22 million to build the middleware for all e-commerce.\n\nWinnipeg-based e-commerce solution developer Bold Commerce announced today the close of a $22 million CAD Series A funding round, led by Whitecap Venture Partners and Round13 Capital. As part of the funding, Whitecap’s Carey Diamond and Round13’s Craig Strong will join Bold’s board of directors.\n\nThe number Bold has raised is a staggering first-time funding total, particularly for a software development company. But with over 20 applications, 275 employees, and 86,000 merchants using its software, the previously bootstrapped e-commerce developer has built an infrastructure and business model primed for growth.\n\nTo become the middleware solutions provider for all e-commerce not found on Amazon, Bold Commerce needed a VC cash injection.\n\nBold Commerce builds apps for e-commerce platforms. Previously, that had simply meant Shopify (TechCrunch once referred to the company as Shopify’s largest app developer and Bold CEO and co-founder Yvan Boisjoli confirmed that’s still the case), but the company recently started supporting competitor BigCommerce. Merchants on each platform can grab apps individually for specific utilities (e.g. subscriptions or multi-currency support) or in pre-set bundles. Bold also offers managed services for merchants, and Boisjoli indicated that the company’s customer base has grown in complexity along with Shopify’s growth, with a newfound focus on enterprise.\n\n“We started with Shopify and we’re growing with Shopify,” he said. “We were there when Shopify only had mom-and-pops, and we were part of Shopify’s transition to Plus as well. I would say that any size customer Shopify has, we have.”\n\nOn top of Bold’s managed service fees, each app, whether sold alone or in a bundle, has its own pricing model. Some may be feature gated by specific pricing tiers, or scale monthly cost by users, or take a transaction fee. This allows each Bold Commerce app and service to be available to the smallest online merchant, but allows Bold to maximize its profit from every customer based upon the merchant’s size and level of activity: the more a merchant uses an app, the more money Bold makes; the more apps a merchant uses, the more money Bold makes.\n\nThe dynamic pricing and network effects separate Bold Commerce from most software developers, and are what made the company so enticing to investors. Speaking with Craig Strong, he told BetaKit that Round13’s investment in Bold was the VC firm’s largest cheque cut to date.\n\n“There are two big chunks,” Strong told BetaKit. “One is recurring revenue through selling any one of their 20 e-commerce apps. The other piece, and where I think this starts to get extremely big, is payments processing. A lot of companies are doing that now, but you can imagine if they get a couple of basis points on every transaction that goes through the platforms they support, they’ll do significantly well at scale.”\n\n“Then we look at their distribution opportunities and that starts to get us really excited.”\n\nExpansions to e-commerce platforms beyond Shopify and BigCommerce should be expected in 2019, and the company is currently working to support crowdfunding and transactions on streaming platforms like Twitch. But to become the middleware solutions provider for all e-commerce not found on Amazon, Bold needed that VC cash injection. With that comes an expected staff doubling over the next eighteen months (Boisjoli is committed to growing in Winnipeg but also said the company is exploring options to ensure it can meet its growth pace).\n\nThe CEO also said Bold Commerce will invest in developing AI-based solutions, which is something that every company that raises funding in 2019 will say, but Boisjoli actually has a pretty good reason: headless commerce. You’ve likely never heard the term, but it refers to a movement that separates the retail purchase process from the traditional point of purchase. Whereas you previously had the physical store and the digital store, now there are just channels – whether it’s your Alexa, your fridge, or your Twitch stream – and few will look like a traditional store.\n\n“What’s happening is you’re starting to see these new channels emerge and you need to have a solution that ties these channels together,” Boisjoli said. “I think we’re in an interesting situation where we can provide really complex solutions in a way that is headless, so merchants can manage their e-commerce experience regardless of channel.”\n\nThe work to integrate all these newfound sales channels agnostically, and automate them in a way that doesn’t overload merchants, is significant. But so is the opportunity for Bold if the company can build a tech stack that supports any merchant sale regardless of how the customer chose to buy it.\n\nStrong wouldn’t go so far as to call Bold Commerce Canada’s next e-commerce darling, but the VC’s excitement was palpable.\n\n“We see Bold as the future of e-commerce. That’s the thing that excited us. It’s easy to imagine a world where everyone is buying in their own particular way, and Bold benefits from all of those purchases, regardless of the starting point.”", "entities": [[0, 13, "org_in_focus"], [21, 32, "money_funded"], [78, 86, "headquarters_loc"], [123, 136, "org_in_focus"], [147, 152, "date_of_funding"], [168, 183, "money_funded"], [184, 192, "type_of_funding"], [215, 240, "investor"], [245, 260, "investor"]]}

Canvera is an online photography and printing solutions platform based out of Bengaluru.\n\nAs per filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Info Edge has participated in a cash transaction for the follow-up investment. Info Edge’s share in the company has now increased to 62.22% after a fresh round of convertible cumulative redeemable preferece shares amounting to 771,419, having a face value of INR 1 each at a premium of INR 110. 48.\n\nThe filings also state that the investee company is a step-down subsidiary of Canvera and this makes it ‘a related party.’\n\nThis is Info Edge’s third round of investment in the online photography printing solutions company.

Using unsupervised machine learning technology, Prelert's Anomaly Detective processes huge volumes of streaming data to learn what normal behavior looks like within an IT environment, and in real time, flags anomalous activity.\n\n\n\n'Enterprise IT environments are simply becoming too big and complex for humans to manage,' said Jason Waxman, vice president of Cloud Platforms Group at Intel. 'Traditional methods of IT security and operations management are quickly becoming ineffective because of the amount of data being created, and the industry needs solutions to this challenge that democratize data science. The Anomaly Detective engine empowers companies to easily identify opportunities and threats within their data, and we're excited to help further development and usage of this unique and important technology through our investment.'\n\n\n\nTraditional approaches to IT security and performance management have not scaled to provide actionable insight as the volume of data that modern IT environments create has grown to as much as terabytes per hour. Because they require human defined rules that can never cover every contingency, thousands of false alerts are generated every day, which often mask important notifications. The volume of data generated requires time-consuming and costly data mining technology, or a team of data scientists to find critical information within this data. Prelert turns this approach on its head by cutting through the noise and automatically identifying security threats and performance issues, enabling companies to improve the security and service levels of their IT systems while reducing overall costs.\n\n\n\n'We've seen far too many instances where major corporations find out too late that cybercriminals have had free reign on their networks for weeks or even months,' said Mark Jaffe, Prelert's CEO. 'These increasingly sophisticated hackers know how to sneak around tripwires set by most security teams but can not avoid leaving fingerprints in the form of anomalous behaviors. The volume and complexity of the data that must be analyzed to find those fingerprints require an automated solution to ferret out malicious activity. Prelert is a first mover in providing the type of meaningful big machine data analytics that operations and security executives have been searching for.'\n\n\n\nPrelert's technology has been proven through more than 100 successful enterprise installations as a deeply integrated app for Splunk and through partnerships that address IT security and APM use cases, including OEM relationships with Alert Logic and CA Technologies. In addition, the company recently opened its API, allowing developers, cloud service providers and technology vendors to integrate is machine learning engine into their environments, and has started offering connectors to the most popular big data technologies such as Elasticsearch. The funding will be used to expand Prelert's engineering and sales teams to help accelerate these types of partnerships and integrations, as well as the growing number of deployments of the technology in enterprises.\n\n\n\nThe Intel Capital investment was led by Director Sean Cunningham.\n\n\n\nAbout Prelert\n\n\n\nPrelert is the anomaly detection company. Its automated behavioral analytics make it easy for users and developers to uncover real-time insights into the operational opportunities and risks hidden in massive data sets.

Using unsupervised machine learning technology, Prelert's Anomaly Detective processes huge volumes of streaming data to learn what normal behavior looks like within an IT environment, and in real time, flags anomalous activity.'Enterprise IT environments are simply becoming too big and complex for humans to manage,' said Jason Waxman, vice president of Cloud Platforms Group at Intel. 'Traditional methods of IT security and operations management are quickly becoming ineffective because of the amount of data being created, and the industry needs solutions to this challenge that democratize data science. The Anomaly Detective engine empowers companies to easily identify opportunities and threats within their data, and we're excited to help further development and usage of this unique and important technology through our investment.'Traditional approaches to IT security and performance management have not scaled to provide actionable insight as the volume of data that modern IT environments create has grown to as much as terabytes per hour. Because they require human defined rules that can never cover every contingency, thousands of false alerts are generated every day, which often mask important notifications. The volume of data generated requires time-consuming and costly data mining technology, or a team of data scientists to find critical information within this data. Prelert turns this approach on its head by cutting through the noise and automatically identifying security threats and performance issues, enabling companies to improve the security and service levels of their IT systems while reducing overall costs.'We've seen far too many instances where major corporations find out too late that cybercriminals have had free reign on their networks for weeks or even months,' said Mark Jaffe, Prelert's CEO. 'These increasingly sophisticated hackers know how to sneak around tripwires set by most security teams but can not avoid leaving fingerprints in the form of anomalous behaviors. The volume and complexity of the data that must be analyzed to find those fingerprints require an automated solution to ferret out malicious activity. Prelert is a first mover in providing the type of meaningful big machine data analytics that operations and security executives have been searching for.'Prelert's technology has been proven through more than 100 successful enterprise installations as a deeply integrated app for Splunk and through partnerships that address IT security and APM use cases, including OEM relationships with Alert Logic and CA Technologies. In addition, the company recently opened its API, allowing developers, cloud service providers and technology vendors to integrate is machine learning engine into their environments, and has started offering connectors to the most popular big data technologies such as Elasticsearch. The funding will be used to expand Prelert's engineering and sales teams to help accelerate these types of partnerships and integrations, as well as the growing number of deployments of the technology in enterprises.The Intel Capital investment was led by Director Sean Cunningham.About PrelertPrelert is the anomaly detection company. Its automated behavioral analytics make it easy for users and developers to uncover real-time insights into the operational opportunities and risks hidden in massive data sets. By using unsupervised machine learning technology, Prelert enables non-data scientists to go beyond the limits of search to quickly derive value from their organization's data.

{"text": "Grenoble-based Diabeloop snaps up €31 million to expand reach of AI device for type 1 diabetes.\n\nFrench company Diabeloop has announced securing a €31 million Series B round of funding, breaking the European record for therapeutic AI fundraising. The round was led by Cemag Invest, as well as French Odyssée Ventures and AGIR à dom, and Indian investment firm ADAG. Diabeloop will put the funding towards commercialising their device across Europe and the US.\n\nDiabeloop, founded in 2015, offers a breakthrough in diabetes management. By leveraging artificial intelligence, treatment can be automated and personalised. Specifically, their ‘handset’ device uses sensors to measure blood sugar, and then pump a calculated dose of insulin to keep blood sugar at a healthy level.\n\nWhile Diabeloop’s device is known as a type of ‘artificial pancreas’, users need to manually tell the device when they eat. This places it at step four of the ‘six stages’ of artificial pancreas technology, where steps five and six mean full automation with no input needed from users. Even so, the device reduces the burden typically associated with treatments, improving quality of life for patients.\n\nTo read more in detail about how it works, we featured Diabeloop in our article “An inside look at Diabeloop: the French startup innovating for autonomous diabetes management”.\n\nThe clinical and quality-of-life benefits of the device were demonstrated through a series of clinical trials, the results of which were presented at the American Diabetes Association 2018 congress and published in The Lancet Digital Health, resulting in the device being approved in the EU in 2018.\n\nDiabeloop was also awarded IPME Phase 2 grant by Horizon 2020, a European program for research and innovation, and to receive renewed support from EIT Health, for the company’s D4Teens program.\n\nReflecting on the success of the Series B fundraising, Erik Huneker, founder and co-CEO of Diabeloop, explains, “Our technology is unique. The Diabeloop-developed algorithm adapts to the physiology and lifestyle of each person, which means the glucose trend prediction and insulin delivery are customized. Patients have provided extremely positive feedback, especially in terms of quality of life, as the daily burden of multiple therapeutic decisions is alleviated.”", "entities": [[0, 8, "headquarters_loc"], [15, 24, "org_in_focus"], [34, 45, "money_funded"], [97, 103, "headquarters_loc"], [112, 121, "org_in_focus"], [147, 158, "money_funded"], [159, 167, "type_of_funding"], [268, 280, "investor"], [293, 316, "investor"], [321, 331, "investor"], [360, 364, "investor"], [461, 470, "org_in_focus"], [483, 487, "year_founded"]]}

In addition, the APTITUDE results will be reviewed during the company’s sponsored symposium: Design Considerations and Clinical Experience of a Novel Thin-Walled High-Performance Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold, which is scheduled for Wednesday, May 17th. APTITUDE is a poly-L-lactide-based, sirolimus-eluting BRS with a strut thickness of 115-microns. Clinical results from 60 patients enrolled in RENASCENT-II indicate high device success rate (98.3%), scaffold stability as assessed by OCT lumen area maintained at 9 months, high level of strut coverage (97.0%) and low rate of malapposition (0.037%, all covered struts) by OCT at 9 months. Importantly, no instances of thrombosis nor binary restenosis have been reported in these patients.\n\nThe company submitted an application for CE Mark for the 115-micron APTITUDE in December 2016, and expects that the CE Mark may be granted in the second half of 2017. Development of a marketing strategy and preparations for commercial launch following allowance of the CE Mark are underway. On the basis of the very positive results from the APTITUDE clinical study, Amaranth plans to begin discussions with potential partners and sources of financing to continue the development of its technology for coronary, peripheral and neurological applications. The company’s near-term efforts also include initial commercial preparations for the world’s first sub-100-micron BRS, MAGNITUDE®, for which the company anticipates a potential market launch in 2018.\n\nJuan F. Granada, executive director and chief innovation officer of the CRF-Skirball Center for Innovation and co-principal investigator of the study, commented, “The BRS field is navigating turbulent waters right now; however, I continue to believe that complete scaffold absorption brings additional value to the patient by decreasing progressive late lumen loss and expanding the re-intervention options in comparison to metallic DES. The technical and clinical performance of the thin-walled APTITUDE BRS has been successfully evaluated in a multi-center clinical trial. I am looking forward to seeing this device used in real-world cases.”\n\n“Clinical outcomes at 9-months for the patients in the RENASCENT-II trial have been excellent, displaying a safety and efficacy profile compared to metallic DES. We hope that long-term data continue to confirm the structural stability and safety of the device and add momentum to the field again,” added Dr. Antonio Colombo, co-principal investigator and director of the Hemodynamics Division at Ospedale San Raffaele in Milan, Italy.\n\nTCT Presentation Details:\n\nNine-month clinical and imaging outcomes of a novel ultra-high molecular weight poly-L-lactide BRS.

{"text": "10 tips on how to raise venture capital in South Africa [Opinion].\n\nEntrepreneurs constantly disrupt the balance of competition by unlocking inventive commercial opportunities and creating new markets in doing so.\n\nThis can sometimes be done by bootstrapping (with minimal financial resources) over time, but because of the rapidly changing environment innovation-driven entrepreneurs operate in, some form of risk funding is usually required to scale viable opportunities. Raising venture capital (VC) is one way to do it.\n\nVC firms invest in early-stage, emerging small firms with high growth potential in exchange for minority equity ownership. But for many SA startups and small businesses, this remains theoretical.\n\nWhile VC is a recognised alternative asset class in many countries, it is still an emerging industry in SA with few (but increasing) VCs around that have limited funds to deploy. Local entrepreneurs seeking risk funding should therefore get resourceful to increase their VC funding chances…\n\nHere’s how VCs can do it:\n\n1) VC backable scalable business model?\n\nVenture capital should not be the go-to funding choice for everyone starting a business. A startup is a high growth potential company in search of a repeatable and scalable business model. Once it gets product or market fit and some traction through the scale-up phase it turns into a so-called “gazelle” – an extremely fast-growing company (not measured off a low base), which maintains consistent expansion of revenue, employment or profit metrics over a prolonged period of time. If your business model does not fit within the spectrum of these definitions it is not VC backable and other funding mechanisms may be more appropriate.\n\n2) Target an investor universe\n\nVC investors will do a thorough due diligence on you, your business and the growth assumptions behind it. Start by turning the tables on them. Do your homework on who the active and credible investors in the market are. Talk to their current or past portfolio companies. Study their investment mandates and make sure you are a good fit for each other. Southern Africa Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (Savca) members and the list of the SA Revenue Service’s (Sars) Section 12J VCCs could help, and increasingly international VCs are turning their sights to Africa so look out for those.\n\n3) Get Referred\n\nIt is not necessarily a well-known fact that most VC deals originate via leads passed on from within the wider trusted networks of the VC community. Use the concept of six degrees of separation to find a way to get introduced. Or trawl the startup scene for networking events. A warm referral to a VC goes a long way to securing that first meeting.\n\n4) Refine Your Elevator Pitch\n\nYou need to be able to convince a VC that your Startup is worth investing in by communicating all of the core elements of your venture in a clear and concise manner. Define your company’s purpose, perfect your one-line pitch and strive to tell a four-word story. Then let your inner circle of friends and mentors know what you are up to.\n\n5) One-page teaser doc\n\nStartups should always have a clinical “one-pager” summary of their business and the investment requirements on hand. Mainly used to immediately follow up when your elevator pitch worked and a potential funder or partner says: “Sounds interesting, can you send me some more info?”. Also makes it easier and more professional when your referral network does an intro by leading with this one-pager.\n\n6) Standard Pitch Deck\n\nYes — we know some entrepreneurs have their own ideas of what information potential VC funders would like to see (keep that on hand for the due diligence data room), but why not just use the tried and tested pitch deck format that is used the world over for the first meeting with a VC that goes something like:\n\n7) Granular financial model\n\nLike it or not, at some level all roads lead to the assumptions behind your financial model. VC’s have heard it all from the ever-present “these projections are conservative” to “real life won’t mimic excel anyway so what’s the point of building a model”. Build a model. And make it granular. We know there will be pivots, delays, underestimation of costs, corporates who pay late and unexpected windfalls. But we need to agree on the basic set of metrics that reflect the commercial DNA of the business. At this snapshot in time.\n\n8) Due diligence data room\n\nA data room is a place where the startup or small business places copies of the financial, legal and business documents that define the history and future of the company. It can be physical, virtual or a combination thereof and is accessed by potential investors during due diligence — usually after having signed a “non-disclosure agreement”. Keep it updated before approaching VC investors as two things happen in an investor’s mind when a startup says: “I can give you access to my virtual data room”… One: they know that this entrepreneurial team has got their act together and managing the partnership post-investment will be a pleasure; and two: there is a perceived sense of urgency as other investors may already be analysing the information. Have a limited data room ready with just the key information that you are willing to share and then also a comprehensive one for when negotiations heat up.\n\n9) Push for term sheet\n\nReal VCs are in the business to invest. If you don’t get a term sheet or letter of intent from a VC to invest within a reasonable timeframe something is wrong. This could be mainly one of two things: For various reasons there is no real interest from the VC and you are in the “slow maybe” pile; or you have not enabled the VC with enough relevant information to make a “yes or no” decision. Figure out which it is. Respond timeously to information requests. Push for a decision either way. If needs be, work through the person that referred you to the VC in the first place.\n\n10) Avoid deal fatigue in due diligence finalisation and legal closing\n\nThis post is not about the intricacies of the due diligence process or legal negotiation tips. But once you have “passed” the due diligence exercise there is usually a working list of things to get done as suspensive conditions to the potential transaction, and the legal closing process takes its course. Some legal tweaks are inevitable. This can be relatively painful if the spirit of partnership is not already present in the way parties negotiate with each other. Avoid so-called deal fatigue by finding sensible compromises to negotiation obstacles, meeting suspensive conditions quickly and working with the best lawyers.\n\n… And put the Champagne on ice!\n\nKeet van Zyl is a partner at South African venture capital fund Knife Capital.

The round includes some striking names, with, amongst others, Wesley ter Haar, founder and COO of MediaMonks, and Christoph Goeken, CEO of M-Venture. Both of the industry savvy investors state that they see the business model of Woov as ‘beyond innovative’, but also share the company’s interest in enabling and enhancing the best experiences in people’s lives.\n\nWesley ter Haar, co-founder and COO of MediaMonks, explains his interest for the company as follows:\n\nI’m a big believer in focused platforms, ones that can create truly amazing experiences because they understand the people at the other end of their app better than anyone else. Woov is uniquely positioned to tie together festivals, parties, nightlife and the meeting and mingling with others, all things that add up to some of the best nights of your life.

This round is a vote of confidence by experts in the space and signifies that we are strongly positioned for the future.’ He continues: “Woov creates technology to enhance live experiences. We want to facilitate going out into the real-world for groups of friends, and to play a role in bringing like-minded people together at live music experiences. This year we’ve been seeing increasing engagement levels at all of our partnered festivals as we add features that solve problems, reduce admin hassle and help organisers and users get more value out of our technology. We’ve been seeing a growing global awareness of Woov at all levels, but more importantly, we’re helping the visitors and our festival partners get morie out of the time they spend together.\n\nChristoph Goeken, Managing Director of Wolfenbüttel-based capital fund M-Venture, the innovation and investment unit of Mast-Jägermeister SE, said:\n\nWoov fully shares our mission to leverage technology to create more ‘best nights of your life’. Their deep cultural expertise of festivals, their commitment to innovation and the connections they help event organisers make with consumers are really unique in the scene and I am looking forward to seeing what else the team creates in the coming years to make ‘going out’ easier and more engaging.\n\nIrfan van Ewijk, founder:\n\nI’ve experienced first hand the frustration of not having access to a reliable and operationally focused app that makes executing events easier for project teams. We wanted to build Woov differently – to make it easier for organisers (at all levels) to access technology that helped them stay closer to their audience and gain insights and visitor feedback into how to improve their events. We think It’s crazy that we live in such a technologically advanced world, yet festival apps have remained these clunky, content-heavy, battery-vampires – that seem more interested in maximising screen-time than getting visitors out of the admin-hassle and back into the show. On the flip side, we’ve built the Woov tech to give the hosts of events an easier way to keep their audiences informed, safe and engaged with their festival brands throughout the year. We’ve still got a lot of innovation coming down the line, so it’s great to have a fresh group of investors and advisors who believe in our vision.\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more updates in the tech startup world.", "entities": [[0, 9, "headquarters_loc"], [37, 41, "org_in_focus"], [49, 52, "money_funded"], [76, 88, "investor"], [93, 103, "investor"], [999, 1004, "headquarters_loc"], [1024, 1028, "org_in_focus"], [1040, 1045, "date_of_funding"], [1084, 1094, "money_funded"], [1158, 1173, "investor"], [1210, 1226, "investor"]]}

Out of 13,000 applications received, the company has selected over 450 exceptional individuals into its program to become startup founders since it launched in 2018.\n\nSince the launch of its first program in Singapore in 2018, Antler has expanded to eight locations so far– Stockholm, New York, London, Amsterdam, Oslo, Sydney and East Africa (Nairobi and Addis Ababa). Two programs take place annually in each city, where after the first phase of the program successful startups receive €100,000 to €150,000 of investment (depending on the region) in funding from Antler for a minority equity stake.\n\nOperating across 15 different industries\n\nAntler’s successful startups are now operating across 15 different industries including FinTech, SpaceTech, Robotics, and HealthTech. Some exciting examples are:\n\nSkyQraft, a system providing affordable and safe infrastructure inspections using drones and AI to detect risks to power lines.

What can take a young startup months and years to accomplish in a new market we can accelerate significantly with our experienced team and advisors.

Following the success stories of Antler programs worldwide, the founders of the first program in Amsterdam are eager to present their startups at the Demo Day on 31 October.

Private sales began on February 1st and have raised more than $1.3 million dollars toward a maximum of $55 million.\n\nTokens will be distributed to raise funds for the jackpot pools and prize awards for people who play the MOS Lottery.\n\n“As the MOS lottery expands its user base globally, it continually builds a layer of trust among players, with every transaction verified by the blockchain,” said Alexander Mittler, MOS Lottery CEO. “MOS Lottery is a perfect use of blockchain for the everyday person and solves player skepticism and concerns about fraud in the current lottery systems,” he added.\n\nOnce MOS Lottery is launched, players will be able to purchase lottery ticket(s) using MOS Tokens or Ether.

{"text": "Silvertree invests R5m in former OrderIn co-founder’s new dark kitchen business.\n\nCape Town based investor Silvertree Holdings has invested R5-million in return for a majority stake in former OrderIn co-founder Heini Booysen’s new dark kitchens business.\n\nAlso known as a “ghost kitchen”, “virtual kitchen” or “cloud kitchen”, Cape Town based Darth Kitchens is a delivery-only establishment that can only be accessed via food delivery apps like UberEats, Mr D and OrderIn.\n\nBooysen (pictured above, centre with Silvertree’s Manuel Koser and UCook’s David Torr) confirmed to Ventureburn today that Silvertree has taken a 51% stake in Darth Kitchens, and that the investor plans to inject a further amount early next year, which Silvertree put at R30-million.\n\nBooysen left OrderIn about a year ago but confirmed that he still has a small stake in the business, which was founded by former Goldman Sachs associate Dinesh Patel in 2012 before Booysen joined as a director a year later.\n\nThe New York co-founder of Seamless, Jason Finger, helped fund OrderIn initially, said Booysen.\n\nSilvertree Holdings has invested R5m in return for a 51% stake, in former OrderIn co-founder Heini Booysen’s new dark kitchens business\n\nBooysen said the R5-million from Silvertree has been used to fit out a 400 square metre premises which previously served as a panel beating shop, off Bree Street in the city centre.\n\nThe funding will also serve as working capital and allow the startup to grow its current team — which currently stands at 20 permanent kitchen staff and five founding members (including two executive chefs who worked at some of South Africa’s best restaurants like The Test Kitchen and Thali).\n\nUCook co-founder is advisor\n\nUcook co-founder David Torr helps out as an advisor. Silvertree has a 50% stake in his business (Silvertree invested R3-million initially in 2016 and then a further R5-million). Booysen says Torr also has a small sweat equity stake in his business, while the remaining stake in Darth Kitchens is made up of his own share and that of an employees stake.\n\nDarth Kitchens kicked off with its first order in August, after Booysen began working on the business in March.\n\nThose that use these apps will not see the name “Darth Kitchens”. Instead they will see the names of the business’s own five brands listed at restaurants. The brands are Buddy’s Burgers, Fluent (Health Bowls), Bagels Shmagels, Anvil Burger Co and Ringo’s NY Style Pizzeria.\n\nBooysen said he didn’t believe customers would see this as a problem. “Whether it comes out of a dark kitchen or not, it’s still coming out of a kitchen,” he added.\n\n‘25% cheaper than traditional restaurants’\n\nWhile the kitchen had to undergo the usual health and fire inspections that restaurants undergo before receiving a license to operate, the dark kitchen has operational costs that are likely 25% less than a normal restaurant, estimates Booysen.\n\nRent is the business’s biggest saving. While the business operates in the city centre, rent is about 20% of what the typical restaurant would pay in the city centre because the premises is an industrial space.\n\nHowever, the reliance on the order app does, he admits, add to the cost.\n\nBetween 20% and 30% of the price that a food item is sold for on an app goes to the ordering app. But Booysen says he doesn’t see this as a major challenge, as he says the revenue his business gives up is in return for the marketing that these apps perform of his food brands.\n\nHowever, he admits that as a dark kitchen one is very often at the mercy of order apps. If for example one has a special on sushi that day, and the dark kitchen doesn’t offer any sushi, the dark kitchen will lose out.\n\nBut then the advantage to being a dark kitchen is that it’s easier to test new offerings and put these out as a “restaurant”. If something doesn’t work, you won’t have to pull down signs and change the decor, as you would if it was a traditional restaurant — you just pull the brand and put a new one up on the app.\n\nWhile its usual for the orderings apps to give restaurants a tablet from which to manage orders, Booysen says the business has integrated the various orders of its five current brands, into a point-of-sale system — to avoid the chaos of having to deal with multiple tablets when accepting orders.\n\n‘Up to $1bn market size’\n\nDark kitchens may be emerging in South Africa but it is not a new concept, with global delivery apps like Deliveroo launching these kitchens in the UK as far back as 2017, the trend has had some time to gain momentum globally.\n\nRecently however this concept is experiencing increased interest from venture capital companies and food tech investors driven largely by players like Uber’s founder, Travis Kalanick.\n\nKalanick raised more than $400-million for his move into the dark kitchen space across the US, India and China and Kitchen United raised more than $40-million from Google Ventures to grow their dark kitchen network across the US.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to estimate the size of the local market (because it depends on customer data held by each of the ordering apps and the sales number of restaurants), Silvertree Holdings managing partner Peter Allerstorfer estimates it to be between R500-million to R1-billion.\n\n‘Walking into this with my eyes wide open’\n\nSilvertree’s move to take majority stakes in the firms it invests in may have been viewed by some founders with suspicion (see this story).\n\nBut Allerstorfer says the investor aims to always ensure that the entrepreneur has a significant stake in the business — and that the entrepreneur is afforded the ability to sell their stake at a later stage. He confirmed that Silvertree is still considering a 2023 listing of its portfolio.\n\nBut does the majority stake that Silvertree has taken in the business effectively mean Booysen works for Silvertree?\n\n“I have known Manuel (Koser) for many years and I am well aware of how they do things. I’m walking into this with my eyes wide open,” says Booysen.\n\nHe says while his experience with past investors has been that they make the investment and then expect only quarterly reports, that with Silvertree has been different.\n\n“These guys are more involved,” he says, pointing out that Koser and his team hold weekly meetings with him and his team and have provided office space, as well as help with legal documents and accounting.\n\nIn addition, Booysen says when the business next needs to raise capital, he will gets first choice on whether to commit his own money or take Silvertree’s.\n\n“I don’t think we’ll ever get to (Silvertree’s stake being) 100%,” he reasons, adding that he expects the business to break even in a few months time, after which there won’t be any need for further outside capital.\n\nRight now he’s looking at where to set up the next dark kitchen. It’s likely to be in Rondebosch in Cape Town or Stellenbosch, he says, while he also plans to set up in Johannesburg soon.\n\nGiven that each kitchen can only really effectively serve a 5km radius, you can expect a lot more dark kitchens soon.\n\nRead more: Silvertree Holdings no longer just a tech investor after rebrand, new investment\n\nRead more: Are these six, SA’s most important venture capitalists?\n\nRead more: Silvertree exits CompareGuru in sale to SA’s SureStart\n\nRead more: Silvertree move to take majority stakes in startups nets mixed view from founders [Updated]\n\nRead more: Is Silvertree’s co-entrepreneur model the answer to Silicon Valley?\n\nRead more: Obsession with raising $1bn to become a unicorn is wrong says Silvertree man\n\nRead more: Silvertree founder takes aim at Silicon Valley model of building African startups\n\n*Correction: We earlier had it that Seamless co-founder Paul Appelbaum funded OrderIn — when it was in fact his co-founder, Jason Finger.\n\nFeatured image: Silvertree Investments director Manuel Koser, Darth Kitchens founder Heini Booysen and UCook co-founder David Torr (Supplied)", "entities": [[0, 10, "investor"], [19, 22, "money_funded"], [33, 40, "org_in_focus"], [107, 117, "investor"], [140, 150, "money_funded"], [192, 199, "org_in_focus"], [772, 779, "org_in_focus"], [928, 932, "year_founded"]]}

Rubikloud plans to use the funding to expand its offices into Europe and Asia as it looks to tackle the global retail market. The company is also focused on execution over the next nine to 12 months; CEO Kerry Liu says that right now, they have more customers than they can deploy, so the expansion will ensure they can keep up with the volume.\n\nRubikloud’s platform migrates data from retailers’ old legacy infrastructure onto the cloud, and allows them to automate decision-making on promotions across stores, loyalty marketing, and mass promotional planning. According to Liu, the retail groups that the company works with can have hundreds of promotions going at once at thousands of stores across the country, with different rules for each promotion.\n\nBut he’s clear that this is not a case of machines replacing humans; this allows buyers to do their job better; over the past few years, they’ve been forced to do manual entry financial analysis that takes away from the job they were hired to do. Users of Rubikloud can also override the platform’s decisions anytime, and the machine learns from that decision and evaluates which was the right decision.\n\n“That’s not a human problem, that’s a machine problem. So now, our systems take those kinds of problems from retailers and we automate them. We automate the computing, decision-making, and execution of that so that all person is supposed to do is do their job, which is negotiating a better discount from vendors go to the store and trade shows and find new products,” Liu said.\n\nRubikoud has been bullish in its mission to tackle enterprise SaaS versus building a low-point solution for retailers, which Liu says makes it easy to lose customers. He says the former is also an area that Canada can lead thanks to a legacy of companies like Nortel, BlackBerry, OpenText, and D2L leading the way.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going be the place where the next Facebook comes. We’ve never had a Facebook in Canada; we’ve never had a pure-play consumer rocketship. Shopify is still a B2B business. But enterprise software, we’ve had two dozen just in Ontario alone in the last 10 years. So let’s talk about what we’re good at here,” Liu said.\n\nIn early 2017, the company announced a partnership with A.S. Watson Group, Asia and Europe’s largest international health and beauty retailer, to deploy its solution across its network of 13,300 retail stores. With an investment from Intel, Rubikloud is hoping to leverage the tech giant’s push to bring in-sensors and partners in the ecosystem to get a better understanding of what’s happening within the store itself in real-time.\n\n“The first three levels of retail that AI will impact and transform will be the supply chain, corporate head office, and front of store,” said Stacey Shulman, chief innovation officer in the Retail Solutions Division at Intel Corporation. “Combining Intel’s focus on retail, IoT and in-store devices with Rubikloud’s intelligent decision automation will further position the two companies to continue as retail AI leaders.”", "entities": [[0, 9, "org_in_focus"], [17, 28, "money_funded"], [29, 37, "type_of_funding"], [43, 48, "investor"], [51, 58, "headquarters_loc"], [65, 74, "org_in_focus"], [88, 103, "money_funded"], [104, 112, "type_of_funding"], [120, 133, "investor"], [155, 172, "investor"], [177, 194, "investor"], [250, 264, "investor"], [269, 274, "investor"]]}

Punchh accepted $20MM in funding led by Sapphire Ventures, who funds category-leading growth technology companies, with participation from Cervin Ventures, bringing their total funding to date to $31MM USD. The new funding will be used to expand the Punchh Marketing Cloud to new industries and roll out predictive marketing capabilities using AI and machine learning.\n\nPunchh is also releasing a new product, Punchh Acquire, which converts anonymous customers into brand loyalists through a broad array of channels including Wifi, SMS, social platforms, Apple Pay, eClub and others. The new Punchh Acquire product, previously available only as a Private Beta, is now available to all Punchh customers and is currently being rolled out by several restaurant chains.\n\nPunchh’s new AI and machine learning tools will empower brick and mortar retailers with the same data-driven, omni-channel marketing strategies that have allowed digital merchants to continually gain market share. By enhancing the Punchh marketing platform with intelligent and predictive consumer profiles, marketers at every level can create impactful, custom campaigns and offers across national, local, sku or even weather-based strata. Punchh is the only marketing solution in the world to combine this array of Omni-channel marketing opportunities with artificial intelligence-driven marketing.\n\n“Companies like Amazon have digital, data-driven, and tailored 1-1 marketing down to a science, while brick and mortar retailers are left data-blind and forced to spray and pray – they don’t learn from your past purchases, can’t recommend products they know you’ll buy, and they aren’t able to send the right offers to you at just the right time,” said Shyam Rao, CEO and co-founder of Punchh. “Consumers that choose to do their shopping online as opposed to going to the store aren’t lazy – online retailers are simply doing a better job at knowing their customers and keeping them loyal with delightful and customized shopping experiences.”\n\nRao continued: “The tools to compete with Amazon do exist and, as Punchh customers like Pizza Hut and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf can attest, brick and mortar retailers now have the tools to identify customers, predict behaviors and execute custom campaigns on the fly that fundamentally increase lifetime customer value.”\n\nPunchh dominates the restaurant marketing world with customers including The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, El Pollo Loco, Pizza Hut, Quiznos, and Smashburger. In addition to the fundraising event and product launches, Punchh has announced the intention to broaden their focus beyond the realm of restaurants and into new vertical markets including Health & Beauty, Convenience Stores, and Gas Stations with more to follow. As part of the push into new markets Punchh is also announcing the launch of Fantastic Sams hair care along with TruFusion, a wildly popular chain of Yoga, Pilates, Barre and Cycling health and fitness stores.\n\n“Punchh is already a global leader in digital marketing solutions for restaurants, which alone would be a fantastic reason to invest in the company,” said Jai Das, managing director, Sapphire Ventures. “But the scope of their technology goes far beyond just restaurants and encompasses all brick-and-mortar stores with a POS. We are excited to bring our global network and expertise to help the Punchh team scale their platform to meet the massive, global opportunity of providing Amazon-like customer insights to brick-and-mortar retailers”\n\nPunchh’s network of restaurant customers includes more than 100 restaurant chains across the globe, representing more than $12B in annual spend by 35 million consumers. Leading restaurant brands have already deployed the new Punchh Acquire product during its Beta test period, including Del Taco and Noodles & Company. Beyond the thousands of restaurants marketing via the Punchh network in the United States, Punchh products are employed in markets as varied as Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAbout Punchh\n\nHeadquartered in San Mateo, CA, Punchh is the world leader in innovative digital marketing products for brick and mortar retailers, combining AI and machine learning technologies, mobile-first expertise, and Omni-Channel communications designed to dramatically increase lifetime customer value. Leading global chains in the restaurant, health and beauty sectors rely on Punchh to grow revenue by building customer relationships at every stage, from anonymous, to known, to brand loyalists, including more than 100 different chains representing more than $12 billion in annual spend.

Recruiting solutions by Gild - specifically Gild Source - are now used by over 65 enterprise companies, such as Box, Red Hat, Rackspace, Zynga and Square.\n\n\n\n\"Gild's customers told me over and over that they get unparalleled results with Gild's solutions, which help them source and land technical talent. This has me very excited to be a part of that effort,\" said Steve Anderson, Founder, Baseline Ventures, which has also invested in companies like Instagram, Path, and Heroku. \"Of all of the companies offering tech recruiting solutions, Gild is by far the fastest growing company in both revenues and customer growth. We like how they differentiate on deep data science and meritocracy. I expect them to use this funding to invest even more heavily in ensuring the success of their customers and to make further gains in the market.\"\n\n\n\n\"We've been using Gild for several months and Gild has consistently given us new candidates that we now know are good, but wouldn't have found elsewhere--the 'hidden talent,' so to speak,\" said Kenny Mendes, Head of Recruiting at Box. \"That's tremendously valuable, when so many companies are going after the same pool of candidates identified by other social recruiting tools.\"\n\n\n\nGild will use the new funding to expand the science backing its offerings, accelerate product innovation and meet rising customer demand.\n\n\n\n\"The amount of the round and the caliber of investors feels like real validation of our model and of the team we have assembled,\" said Sheeroy Desai, Co-Founder and CEO of Gild. \"The market is telling us that hiring and recruiting are ready for what we bring to the table: how to utilize Big Data to uncover and evaluate top developer candidates based on actual skills, rather than pedigree or personal connections.\"\n\n\n\nGild is powered by proprietary technology that scours the web for information on developers, including their public code and contributions to developer forums, and then utilizes patent-pending algorithms to score the skills of the millions of developers it finds. This lets companies move past the noise in today's recruiting arenas and hire based on merit alone--finding the developer who really can do the work, regardless of location, SEO keywords or social connections.\n\n\n\n\"From the start, Gild has positioned itself as a forward thinker focused on meeting the needs of a new paradigm of recruiting practices,\" said Bryan Power, Director of Talent at Square. \"By offering tools that allow recruiters to quickly sift through large pools of candidates--and match the specific skills and idiosyncrasies of the candidate with the hiring organization--Gild helps identify hidden talent that traditional methods might miss, building better teams at a lower cost.\"\n\n\n\nFor more information on Gild, visit: http://www.gild.com/company/press\n\n\n\nAbout Gild\n\nHR and recruiting have been begging for innovation.

It’s not only easy to reach from the Eastern European and Central Asian countries, but also has less strict visa requirements for non-EU countries’ residents. On the ground, Rockstart partnered with Tekwill, an organization busy building up the local entrepreneurial ecosystem that has a 4,000m² hub for startups in Chișinău. The program is also supported by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) within the “Moldova ICT Excellence Center Project.”\n\n“Founder-friendly and sustainable ecosystem” for Moldova\n\n“By bringing Rockstart to Moldova Tekwill expects to gain experience and learn how to run a program for early stage startups,” said Caterina Rutter, community manager at Tekwill. “We will get a better opportunity to create a founder-friendly and sustainable ecosystem for Eastern European tech startups. The Rockstart brand will help Tekwill to promote Moldova as one of the best places to turn your idea into a real startup. Also, since Tekwill provides co-working spaces, a partnership with Rockstart will ensure that we provide entrepreneurs with the best support to launch their startups, within and beyond Moldova.”\n\n“Unicorn founders don’t just come from tech hubs”\n\n“Having worked with startups from all over the world as part of our Rockstart Smart Energy accelerator, I saw that our best entrepreneurs didn’t just come from tech hubs such as London or San Francisco, they came from everywhere,” said Karin van Soest, program manager of the Rockstart Launchtrack Moldova program. “However, not all of them have had the same access to knowledge and support. Entrepreneurs originating from emerging ecosystems need access to the right tools and mentorship to be able to launch a tech startup. Moldova is a fast emerging startup ecosystem with highly engaged entrepreneurs. Being developer focused, they are well able to build great products. They have the drive to dream big enough to go global, looking to San Francisco as a role model. But there are very few successful local founders to learn from, and the financial and mentorship support they need is scarce. I believe that by supporting entrepreneurs in emerging regions with our key knowledge and experience we can create a great impact and help many more succeed in their first steps towards a global presence.”\n\n60 days of learning—but mostly on the weekends\n\nFor the program, Rockstart is looking for teams or even individual founders on the pre-MVP stage, i.e. having an idea or an early prototype of their product. The entrepreneurs are asked to pay a symbolic fee of €250 per startup, which, however, can be waived. The program is divided into four steps—”Problem validation,” “Problem-solution fit,” “Global market potential,” and “Investment-ready.” Each step ends with a milestone that the startup has to pass in order to keep going. The selected founders are expected to stay in Moldova for the duration of Launchtrack, although the program’s modules will mostly be held from Friday to Sunday.", "entities": []}

Under this, any global companies will not be able to make a data bank outside India.\n\nThere is another type of data called non-personal data, which is a bit different. It does not allow traceability, but it is the accumulation of data used by digital companies to push their products and services.\n\nTalking about data protection, in August 2019, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, had clarified that India needs to draw a distinction between personal and non-personal data.

This costs R2 500 per company, and all monies received will be used to advance high-growth black entrepreneurial skills development in South Africa, putting BEE entrepreneurs on the UCT GSB investment course via the EntFarm initiative.\n\nThe final 10 companies will then be chosen for the nine-month Grindstone programme, which costs R10 000 per company, with all monies to be used in a ‘Stokvel’ manner for the CEO of the company that shows best improvement in their growth metrics.\n\nKnife Capital does not profit from these fees, and will derive income via long-term upside incentive of investing in some participating companies cultivated through the programme on an arm’s-length basis and from commission on external funding arranged (if needed). Furthermore Knife Capital will not take equity in any of the companies participating upfront, unless the companies agree on arm’s-length funding terms later on.\n\nGrindstone applications close 23 August.", "entities": []}

{"text": "UAVenture Capital Fund Invests in New Uses of Carbon Fiber.\n\nTUCSON, Ariz., Sept. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- UAVenture Capital, a Tucson-based venture capital fund dedicated to the commercialization of discovery products, technology and services emerging from the University of Arizona, today announced its third and fourth investments for Fund II, its eighth and ninth investment since launching the Fund.\n\nThe fund has invested in CarboShield Inc., which has developed an easy, low-cost way to strengthen thousands of aging steel, concrete and wood bridges across the globe. The company is currently responding to worldwide infrastructure repair projects by utilizing carbon fiber prefabricated forms, which are 10 times stronger than steel. The patented process negates the current repair processes by allowing the original structure to remain intact. Unlike carbon fiber wrapping currently in use, which takes significant time and manpower, CarboShield's product is rapidly installed, is virtually permanent, and can be simply installed with no environmental impact.\n\nThe fund has also invested in MediCarbone Inc., the patent holder of a flexible carbon fiber fabric inserted inside and around a fractured bone. The fabric is filled with an inert polymer to inflate the fabric, which then acts as a permanent cast which cannot be rebroken. The technology could replace a traditional cast and can be used on human or animal broken bones when a traditional cast is not viable.\n\nThe invested funds from UAVC will support further development of the technologies in both companies. CarboShield already has several potential customers and projects worldwide and plans to install its product in approximately three months. MediCarbone's product will require U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for human trials. However, the company plans to begin testing in animals in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThe inventor of both technologies is Hamid Saadatmanesh, professor of engineering in the Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering and Mechanics. Saadatmanesh is recognized throughout the world as an expert in carbon fiber applications.\n\n\"Hamid is a brilliant engineer who has used his entrepreneurial skills and imagination to solve significant worldwide issues through the creative use of carbon fiber. We see huge opportunities for both infrastructure repair and medical utilization of his inventions,\" said Fletcher McCusker, CEO and founder of UAVenture Capital.\n\nDoug Hockstad, assistant vice president of Tech Launch Arizona, the UA unit that commercializes technologies and innovations originating from the UA, noted the unique nature of MediCarbone's product.\n\n\"We are excited about Dr. Saadatmanesh's innovation for bone repair because of the difference the medical application can make and the lack of anything similar in the marketplace,\" he said. \"This kind of creative application of carbon fiber technology is yet one more example of how Arizona is engaged in moving the fourth industrial revolution forward.\"\n\n\"As the eighth and ninth investment in UA technology by UAVenture Capital, these ventures are exciting applications of Dr. Saadatmanesh's research, and amazing examples of the kind of research the UA can produce with positive global impact,\" said Robert C. Robbins, president of the University of Arizona. \"The ability to accelerate UA discoveries into the marketplace is integral to our role as a global land-grant university, and fundamentally important in our new strategic plan. We are pleased that UAVenture Capital continues to engage with our faculty to help create an ecosystem of research, innovation, invention and commercialization, and I am delighted every time we learn of world-changing inventions by our faculty, students and staff, and the opportunities they create here at the University of Arizona.\"\n\nAbout UAVC\n\nUAVenture Capital Fund II, LLC is a Tucson based investment fund designed specifically to help finance University of Arizona connected enterprises including the commercialization of faculty led innovations originating at the UofA.

{"text": "VC is growing in Africa, but sector still hobbled by lack of follow-on and seed funding.\n\nTen years ago when Cape Town venture capitalist Justin Stanford and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham launched Cape Town’s startup initiative Silicon Cape there was hardly an angel or VC fund in sight in South Africa, local or foreign — and barely anything to speak of in the rest of Africa.\n\n“It was a sparse and difficult landscape with many obstacles,” recalls Stanford, a partner at 4Di Capital in an email to Ventureburn last week.\n\nFast track to today and the VC and angel investment sector looks totally different.\n\nSays Stanford: “Since then we have seen a notable rise in the prevalence of all of these, and the rate of change appears to be accelerating. In particular foreign funders are becoming increasingly active”.\n\nAfrica’s VC sector is growing, but still faces significant challenges, such as a lack of follow-on funding and angel investors\n\nIn South Africa the introduction of Section 12J VC tax incentive has increased the number of funds and the amount of capital available to be deployed to entrepreneurs (see this story).\n\nWith the increase in VC funding on the continent, Stanford reckons there’s now even an oversupply of capital in certain verticals in East Africa.\n\nRise and rise of VC in Africa\n\nDriven by the growth of smartphone adoption, Africa’s VC sector has become something of a success story. By some accounts 2019 may turn out to be one of the sector’s best year’s ever.\n\nData on the sector is scant and is often dependant on what definition for a tech startup one employs.\n\nThe most recent report, by French VC Partech Africa in March, found that 146 African tech startups raised $1.163-billion in equity funding last year over 164 rounds. The figure marked what Partech said is a 108% year-on-year growth in funding raised by tech startups on the continent (see this story and below for more related to data on the sector).\n\nAn optimistic Olu Oyinsan, a partner at Oui Capital, expects the total amount of VC funding in Africa to grow by another 50% this year to about $1.5-billion.\n\nIt’s no wonder Kingson Capital‘s Gavin Reardon calls the prospects for Africa’s VC sector “very exciting”, particularly for fintech.\n\n“There has been good growth and smartphone penetration is making tech even more accessible to the masses,” he adds.\n\nSilvertree Holdings‘ managing director Paul Cook echoes these comments when he says the VC sector in Africa has developed, pointing out that there are more VCs, more credible VCs, and more deals taking place on the continent now than before.\n\n“We remain excited by the intersection of timeless brand building skills with new economy routes-to-market, to reach African consumers in new and disruptive ways,” he adds.\n\nCook says for example Nigeria and to an extent Kenya are starting to appear on the global VC landscape as investment targets.\n\nBut he adds that South Africa on the other hand is probably somewhat less likely to attract global VC capital than five years ago — among other things, largely because the SA economy has slowed and because a wave of ecommerce investments made a few years ago (by Naspers, Tiger Global, Rocket Internet and others) has since declined, he says.\n\nLack of follow-on funding, seed capital\n\nBut despite this, the sector still faces significant challenges — such as a lack of follow-on funding and angel investors.\n\nBamboo Capital Partners managing partner Florian Kemmerich agrees that while there has been major growth in the African startup scene, angel investment in Africa is virtually “non-existent”.\n\n“The startups don’t get the same level of seed funding as Western companies and they often raise funds for a Series-A round too early as a result,” he says.\n\nHe says fundraising mechanisms with an adjusted risk-reward scenario need to become more commonplace to allow investors to enter at the seed stage.\n\n“This will help African startups prove their concept, raise money for a Series A round and start to scale their business. Regulation is also important, we want to encourage foreign investors to invest in these companies too.”\n\nKnife Capital partner Keet van Zyl says while the number of startups that have been able to raise funding at a Series-A level has grown, a “significant gap” in funding still exists at seed stage and for follow-on funding\n\n“When it comes to African entrepreneurs, we may have one of the largest mismatches in the world between the size of the opportunities and the amount of capital required to access them.\n\n“Compared to peer economies, the venture capital market in the region is drastically under-serviced with available investment capital.\n\n“Seed funding is scarce, however on the back of initial startup successes and an increased focus on building a cohesive technology ecosystem, the funding gap is closing for companies at the early growth stage.\n\n“But a Series-B crunch looms for the crop of startups that have gotten over the Series-A funding hump and now require significant risk funding for aggressive growth at breakout stage,” he points out.\n\nHe says while the private equity sector is well established in South Africa, the VC sector is still emerging.\n\n“VC can play a critical role in creating commercially feasible entrepreneurial ventures, but it needs to be fostered and its unique local differentiating factors still defined,” he adds.\n\nLack of institutional funding\n\nHe says a lack of institutional funding is one of the main challenges that the sector faces, as most funding for startups still comes from private individuals or angel investors.\n\nAnother challenge, he says, is building team capacity for value-adding post-investment portfolio management.\n\nVan Zyl believes the growth of VC can be sped up by enabling more fund-of-fund capital sources to commit funding to VCs and by carrying out more fund manager training or support initiatives to build more successful VCs.\n\nVan Zyl’s concern is echoed by Oui Capital’s Oyinsan. Oyinsan says a lack of institutional funders remains a critical bottleneck to the growing VC sector.\n\nHe says African institutional limited partnerships (LPs) need to be allocating more to VC — from insurance companies, to larger asset management companies and pension funds.\n\n“For example, Fortune 1000 pension plans in the US currently have about 4% of their total VC/PE portfolio allocated to Africa compared to only 0.2% by Nigerian pension funds. Closing this kind of gap will go a long way to spur the growth of the ecosystem while offering investors attractive returns,” he says.\n\nIn addition, Silvertree’s Cook believes there’s still an overemphasis by those in the tech startup sector on co-working spaces, so-called tech “hubs” and pitching events.\n\n“The VC industry is still very small, so it is almost always not a viable strategy to collect a team of inexperienced first-time entrepreneurs, build a pitch deck, and hope for the best. Startups need to focus on building a business, and some formal business experience on the team is very helpful,” he points out.\n\n‘Two steps forward, one step back’\n\nDavid van Dijk (pictured above), the co-founder and director general of the African Business Angels Network (ABAN), remains more cautious about trumpeting VC’s success in Africa.\n\n“(It) always feels like it’s two steps forward and one step back. Like every year there are new funds and new players that take an interest in African tech, bringing new capital and fresh ideas, which is great. At the same time it still feels like we are still only scratching the surface of what is possible.\n\n“We are nowhere near bringing out the full potential of local talent. Only so many entrepreneurs break through and only so many opportunities become a reality.”\n\nThese days venture capitalists might be smiling more about Africa than before, but they need to take a long hard look at how to overcome the challenges that the sector still face. The hard work is no where near over yet.\n\n*Ventureburn writer Daniel Mpala also contributed to writing this article.\n\nRead more: African tech startups raised over $1.2bn in funding in 2018 – Partech report\n\nRead more: African funding figures – what’s the real number?

In addition, the young company announced that within the past three years, its online lending platform has issued more than €120 million in credit lines to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nJens Woloszczak, Spotcap Founder and CEO: “We’ve experienced significant growth over the past three years, which is a testament to the fundamental need SMEs have for flexible and accessible financing. With close to 60% of our current loan book being attributed to our global partner network, it’s fair to say our partners have had a significant hand in our success.”\n\nThe company has established a distribution network of more than 10,000 intermediaries including financial advisors, accountants and finance brokers.

{"text": "Laminate Medical, Developer of the VasQ™ External Vascular Support Device, Has Completed an Investment from Valiance.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Israeli start-up Laminate Medical Technologies, developer of the VasQ™ External Vascular Support Device for arteriovenous fistulas in patients requiring dialysis, today announces the completion of a capital raising following an investment from the London-based Valiance Asset Management, through its Luxembourg domiciled Life Sciences Global Investment Fund, in addition to the investment announced earlier this year. This is the first investment by a Valiance fund in an Israeli company.\n\nVasQ (shown above) is a dual-component, nitinol external support for the arteriovenous anastomosis of hemodialysis patients. The device, placed around the artery-vein surgical connection, provides structural support necessary to ensure maturation of the fistula into a usable access for dialysis.\n\nLaminate's flagship device, VasQ, is in use today in hundreds of hospitals across Europe with impressive results. Dialysis patients require surgically created arteriovenous fistulas to facilitate renal replacement therapy. However, arteriovenous fistulas have a historically high primary failure rate, requiring patients to experience multiple additional procedures or even to receive an entirely new arteriovenous fistula. VasQ's unique design provides an external support for the fistula to promote usability without the need for multiple procedures and minimizes the risk of primary failure requiring a new creation. The success of VasQ has been demonstrated in a recently published randomized controlled study in the American Journal of Kidney Disease, as well as by independent reports from commercial use.\n\nIn addition, following the capital raise, Jose Calle Gordo, a Managing Partner at Valiance, will join Laminate as a member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Calle Gordo has served in senior positions at a number of medical device corporations including Biosensors International, Abbott, Guidant and Eli Lilly prior to joining Valiance.\n\n\"We are excited to invest in Laminate and believe that Laminate's VasQ system is a unique innovative solution that transforms the way fistulas are created, reducing the burden to patients and to society of the problems associated with fistula failure,\" said Mr. Calle Gordo .\"We are also happy to partner with Tammy Gilon, founder and CEO of Laminate Medical, to help the company expand and to obtain further regulatory approvals in order to treat dialysis patients globally. This investment represents the first by a Valiance fund into the Israeli MedTech ecosystem, as well as the first life sciences investment by a Valiance fund outside of Europe and North America, underlining the firm's global reach.\"\n\n\"The investment by Valiance reflects our current momentum over the past year and is an expression of their belief in Laminate's capabilities\", said Tammy Gilon. \"After establishing ourselves in key countries, foremost among them the German market, and in recent months also expanding into other countries including Italy, Spain, France and Sweden, this capital raise will now enable us to focus our marketing efforts on the USA. We are operating in the American market today within the framework of a clinical trial conducted in major hospitals across the country, as part of our preparations for a full commercial entry in 2020.\"\n\n\"We have succeeded in gathering an impressive group of investors, with broad experience across different areas of activity within the world of medical equipment, who understand the need for the solution that VasQ offers to dialysis patients. There is no doubt that the addition of Valiance also provides the added value of professionals with experience and know-how in the world of medicine, and we welcome them,\" added Gilon.\n\nThis is Laminate's second round of capital raising in less than a year, after completing a round at the beginning of 2019 which included an investment by the leading manufacturer of dialysis equipment in Japan, Asahi Kasei Medical, together with investments by the American investment fund Tal Capital, and private investors, including Mickey Boodaei, Shai Agassi, Yuval Tal and Meir Barel. They join the company's existing investors, who include the Chinese pharma company Haisco, Nava and Yehuda Zissapel, Zohar Gilon, Eri Steimatzky, Henit Vitos, and Ari Rabad. Laminate was founded in 2012 by Tammy Gilon, who serves as CEO of the company, and Dr. Eyal Orion.\n\nVasQ has already received European CE approval and is commercialized locally by means of a broad network of distributors in Italy, Switzerland, and Austria. There has been significant uptake in Germany following approval of NUB insurance indemnification, regulating receipt of authorized reimbursements from the country's insurance companies to cover the cost of the device.\n\nThe research and development center of Laminate Medical Technologies is in Ramat HaHayal in Tel Aviv, with branches in the USA and Germany. The company has 22 employees.\n\nFor a demonstration video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W3HoTH2x58\n\nTo the company's website:\n\nhttp://www.laminatemedical.com/\n\nFor further details\n\nLaminate: Gil Kraiem, Pitch Media, gil@pitch-media.com\n\n+972-50-5703090\n\nValiance: investor.relations@valiance-am.com\n\nSOURCE Laminate Medical Technologies\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.laminatemedical.com/", "entities": [[0, 16, "org_in_focus"], [108, 116, "investor"], [119, 135, "headquarters_loc"], [137, 150, "date_of_funding"], [171, 178, "headquarters_loc"], [188, 217, "org_in_focus"], [432, 457, "investor"], [4955, 4984, "org_in_focus"], [4991, 5004, "headquarters_loc"], [5008, 5016, "headquarters_loc"], [5367, 5396, "org_in_focus"], [5413, 5444, "org_url"]]}

The company expects to launch the new platform and app — which is aimed at the short-term insurance market — in the last quarter of this year.\n\nSmith said while there are a number of peer-to-peer insurance providers in the market currently, Pineapple — which is underwritten by Johannesburg based underwriters Compass Insurance — offers a more effective model for users.\n\nThe platform will compete with existing short-term insurance offered by the likes of local insurance companies such as MyWay, Outsurance and Santam.\n\nWhile Smith did not want to reveal too much on how the model works he was able to confirm that the platform allows users to pay and track their premiums online, while incentivising users to choose who in their network they want to pool their premiums with.\n\n“We allow users to see exactly what’s going on with their premium and how much is left over,” added Smith.\n\nHe said once any payments to settle claims in their network are factored in and Pineapple fees are taken into account, members can also get paid out on whatever amount from their premium that remains unused and would ordinarily have been accrued to the insurance provider as profit.\n\nAs users will be incentivised to reduce unnecessary claims (to increase the amount they get in reimbursements), encouraging users to choose who they want to include in their network also acts as a way to cut down on fraud — which he estimated accounted for over a third of short-term insurance claims are fraudulent.\n\nSmith said the Pineapple team currently consists just of the three founders, but that the three expect to make new hires soon.\n\nFeatured image: Pineapple co-founders (from left to right) Ndabenhle Junior Ngulube, Marnus van Heerden and Matthew Elan Smith (Supplied)", "entities": [[0, 2, "headquarters_loc"], [11, 20, "org_in_focus"], [29, 34, "money_funded"], [76, 78, "headquarters_loc"], [97, 106, "org_in_focus"], [119, 131, "money_funded"], [135, 139, "type_of_funding"], [153, 168, "investor"], [303, 315, "headquarters_loc"], [339, 348, "date_of_funding"]]}
{"text": "New R150m Opus Ventures fund plans to invest R3m in Khomba taxi app [Updated].\n\nUPDATE (27 March 2019): Khomba co-founder Sizwe Cele responded to Ventureburn subsequent to the publication of this article to say that his startup has not received any funding from Smart Billion Investments (this article had initially stated that the startup had received R16m from the investor), but rather is in talks with the investor as well as three other investors, to obtain investment. Cele however did say that the mobility startup has raised R15.5-million in the last three years of development, from himself, co-founder Meco Mugnaioni as well as from various “friends and family”.\n\nA new R150-million Section 12J venture capital (VC) fund, Opus Ventures, which aims to invest in mainly black-owned tech startups, has already earmarked its first deal — a R3-million investment in taxi app Khomba.\n\nThe fund’s head Zuko Tisani told Ventureburn yesterday that the deal has not yet been concluded, but that his fund which was set up recently, aims to take an eight percent stake in the startup.\n\nThe startup helps minibus taxi commuters to better optimise the affordability and length of their commute by finding nearby minibus taxis. Taxis are fitted with WiFi to enable them to be located by those using the app.\n\nThe idea, Tisani said, is that once the deal is concluded the fund will monitor the investment in Khumba for 18 months before deciding whether to invest more in the startup.\n\nKhomba co-founder Sizwe Cele said his startup, which is still trialling the app, is also in talks with four other investors — including Johannesburg based Smart Billion Investments — to obtain funding. He said the startup is looking for R200-million in funding.\n\nCele said his mobility startup has raised a collective R15.5-million in the last three years of development, from himself, co-founder Meco Mugnaioni as well as from various “friends and family”.\n\nWhile Tisani said the startup is valued at R41-million, Cele said the valuation was made in December and is now likely far higher as his team had “built so much more since then”.\n\nHe said has spent three years developing the product, which he described as being “a battle”. His startup is currently piloting the app and he said the company expects to launch it to market at the end of May.\n\nOpus Ventures, which aims to raise R150-million to invest in mainly black-owned tech startups, has earmarked Khomba as its first deal\n\nVentureburn sought confirmation yesterday from Smart Billion’s Thulani Mogafe on the investment, but he did not wish to comment.\n\n‘Under R30m raised so far’\n\nOpus Ventures was approved by the SA Revenue Services (Sars) as a Section 12J VC fund in January, shows a list (opens as PDF) on the Receiver’s website. The fund is being administered by Grovest, which also administers a number of other Section 12J funds on behalf of clients.\n\nThe VC tax incentive, set up under Section 12J of the Income Tax Act, allows investors who make investments in approved VCs — that then invest in qualifying small companies — a tax deduction.\n\nThe fund is chaired by Business Leadership SA chief executive Bonang Mohale and Tisani said his fund aimed to raise the R150-million from both high net worth black individuals and from corporate agreements linked to the BEE scorecard’s supplier development element. So far the fund has raised under R30-million, he said.\n\nTisani also provides consulting work through his company Legazy Technologies, helping the government and corporates to co-ordinate foreign networking and trade events for black startups.\n\n‘We’ll also target white-owned firms’\n\nTisani is partnering with Devon Alexander as general partner and Brandon Katz — who by day works at Catalyst Research Solutions as a consultant who advises on various government incentives available to businesses.\n\nWhile Tisani told Ventureburn that the fund would look to invest in black-owned tech startups, Katz told the publication in an email earlier this week that the fund would look at white-owned companies too — although ideally it would seek to deploy funds into “small ideally black-owned companies”.\n\n“The concept behind Legazy is to identify companies that can benefit from having a BEE level to get access into large corporates. We have a big network of companies that we can help the startups get into. So, we will look at any company,” he said.\n\nKatz pointed out that the fund is 100% black-owned by virtue of the fact that the fund is owned solely by Tisani, who is black. This he said meant that by default all investments the fund make will be “BEE equity transactions”.\n\nUnder Section 3.10 of the BEE Amended Codes of Good Practice which regulates Private Equity Funds, a fund is deemed black owned if at least 51% of any assets under management fees that are earned go to black people and if the fund invests at least 51% of the funds into 25% black owned companies.\n\nKatz said he had no equity in the fund. “I just help identify companies, help with business development and help fund raise.\n\n“If a company invests into a fund purely for an ESD (enterprise supplier development) write-off then that would be their stance and it doesn’t matter because we would deploy that capital into small black-owned companies,” he said.\n\n“We not really looking for a unicorn, we would rather build 50 companies doing R100-million turnover (sic). South Africa isn’t the right market for a unicorn but it is ripe for disruption in many industries,” he added.\n\nHe said the fund “ideally” would invest in “innovative tech firms” but that traditional businesses that could with a bit of funding develop an online tech platform which would help scale the company, would also be considered.\n\nFeatured image: Khomba Taxi App via Facebook", "entities": [[10, 23, "investor"], [45, 48, "money_funded"], [52, 58, "org_in_focus"], [732, 745, "investor"], [846, 856, "money_funded"], [880, 886, "org_in_focus"]]}

The premium placement and rights offering combination optimises our shareholder and capital structures, which should allow us to move ahead with acquiring the Sierra Miranda claims surrounding Coro’s flagship Marimaca project and commence a fully funded exploration program on these properties, which I believe has significant potential. The proceeds will also be used to pay off debt and fund our working capital needs. Consequently, I am confident that Coro now represents a premier investment opportunity in the junior copper sector, and places us in an unrivalled position to create significant value over the next 12 months.\n\nThe Board of Directors welcomes Tembo Capital as a shareholder. Their willingness to invest at a premium and provide a standby guarantee for the rights offering is a solid endorsement of our Marimaca project and its growth potential. Tembo Capital is a well known private equity group and we look forward to benefitting from their technical and strategic contributions”.\n\nPrivate Placement\n\nThe Company has closed the Private Placement consisting of common shares of the Company (“Common Shares”) raising gross proceeds of approximately CAD 13.2 million. Under the Private Placement, the Company has issued 109,733,334 Common Shares at a price of CAD 0.12 per Common Share, representing a premium of 26% to Coro’s closing price on the TSX on August 3rd, 2018. Tembo Capital has purchased all of the Common Shares issued pursuant to the Private Placement. Pursuant to the Private Placement Tembo Captial, for so long as it continues to hold at least 10% of the outstanding Common Shares of Coro, on a non-diluted basis, will have (i) the right to nominate one member to the Board of Directors, and (ii) a pre-emptive right to maintain its pro rata interest in the Common Shares of Coro.\n\nA significant portion of the proceeds of the Private Placement, being approximately CAD 7,680,030, were used to fund the previously announced acquisition of the Sierra Miranda claims adjacent to the Marimaca property, the balance of such proceeds will be used to advance exploration at the Company’s flagship Marimaca project and for general corporate purposes.\n\nConversion of Greenstone Convertible Loan\n\nThe Company separately announces that 21,883,492 Common Shares are expected to be issued in the coming days to Greenstone pursuant to the conversion of its US$2 million convertible loan, at a conversion price equal to the Private Placement price of CAD 0.12 per share (the “Greenstone Loan Conversion”). The Greenstone Loan Conversion is expected to be completed on or about August 9th, 2018.\n\nFollowing the issue of Common Shares to Tembo Capital pursuant to the Private Placement and the Greenstone Loan Conversion, the total number of Common Shares outstanding will be 783,546,337. The percentage interest of Greenstone in the Common Shares of Coro will have fallen from 63.5% to 55.6%, with Tembo Capital holding 14.0% of the then outstanding Common Shares.\n\nRights Offering\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved the undertaking of a prospectus exempt Rights Offering to be made only to holders of record of Common Shares as of August 22nd, 2018.

The primary use of funds continues to be on the preclinical and clinical advancement of its lead product candidate, PMD-026, a proprietary first-in-class orally-available RSK (kinase) inhibitor. PMD-026 is being developed as a platform technology to treat resistant forms of cancer, such as metastatic breast cancer and, more specifically, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\n\nInvestors in the financing round included Pallasite Ventures and World Changing Ventures.\n\n\"We are proud to help fund the PhoenixMD team in their mission to develop better therapeutic options for women with breast cancer,\" said Dr. Christopher Bissonnette, Managing Partner of Pallasite Ventures. \"We believe PMD-026 is a promising new approach to treat advanced breast cancer, both as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. We are looking forward to working with the team and fellow investors to advance this important product into the clinic.\"\n\nThe company's Phase 1/1b clinical trial is being conducted at leading medical centers across United States and it will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of PMD-026 in patients with metastatic breast cancer as well as a sub-group of women with TNBC. Importantly, this trial will include a College of American Pathologists/Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CAP/CLIA) certified companion diagnostic (CDx) designed to detect RSK2 activation in breast tumors and to then correlate it with response to PMD-026. Activated RSK2 is highly prevalent in breast cancer as it is expressed in approximately 89 percent of primary tumors. It is also detected in metastatic breast cancers, indicating that this drug target is retained in cancer cells that have moved to other parts of the body. The targeting of RSK2 by PMD-026, together with a validated CDx detecting activated RSK2 in tumors, create a distinct precision medicine approach to treating breast cancer.\n\n\"As a company in a challenging disease space, we appreciate the vote of confidence from our investors who join us in the pursuit of new medicines for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\" said Sandra Dunn, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Phoenix Molecular Designs. \"Our seed funding has supported the early development of our lead product candidate, PMD-026, and we are delighted to have opened our Phase 1/1b clinical trial.\"\n\nThe advancement of PMD-026 in the company's clinical trial is underscored by their teams' impressive track record of market success in developing targeted therapies for breast cancer. Previously, this team has brought forward FDA-approved CDK4/6, PARP, ER and PIK3CA oral selective small molecule inhibitors. PhoenixMD looks forward to building upon this momentum in the pursuit of additional treatment options for individuals living with TNBC.\n\nAbout PMD-026\n\nPhoenixMD's lead candidate, PMD-026, is the first RSK inhibitor being developed for the treatment of TNBC. PMD-026 was precisely designed for TNBC because RSK2 was specifically identified as the key kinase, out of 519 kinases, that drives the growth of this breast cancer subtype. Preclinical data shows the potential for PMD-026 to be effective alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapies. It has the potential to be a platform technology for chemotherapy, hormone therapy and/or immunotherapy sensitization for a wide range of refractory cancers in the future. PMD-026 has begun Phase 1/1b clinical trials in the United States with the first site initiated at the end of October 2019.\n\nAbout Phoenix Molecular Designs\n\nPhoenixMD is a privately-held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company designing precise cancer therapeutics and companion diagnostics by targeting kinases, a class of highly druggable enzymes to treat a wide range of oncology indications. PhoenixMD is focused on developing first-in-class inhibitors against RSK, an important drug target for cancer, heart disease and inflammation. The company's leadership team boasts previous expertise in developing FDA-approved and marketed drugs for breast cancer. Due to PhoenixMD's emerging leadership in kinase inhibition, the company has entered into partnerships with well-recognized government, academic research institutions and patient advocates, including the National Cancer Institute, MD Anderson, Kyushu University (Japan), University of Tuebingen (Germany) and the Susan G. Komen Foundation –San Diego. PhoenixMD has clinical headquarters in San Diego, CA and pre-clinical operations in Vancouver, BC.

The round was led by RiverVest Venture Partners, and included investments by New Enterprise Associates, BioMed Ventures and individual investors. Amplyx will use the funding to advance the clinical development of APX001, the company's broad-spectrum antifungal agent to treat life threatening fungal infections.\n\n\n\nThe company plans to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials of APX001 in 2016 to support a Phase 2 program in candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis and rare molds. APX001 has a novel mechanism of action and has shown broad-spectrum activity in animal models of infection by common species of Candida and Aspergillus, as well as high potency against rare molds. Amplyx is developing both intravenous and oral formulations of APX001 to address the need for hospital-based administration, as well as continued convenient administration after hospital discharge.\n\n\n\n'There is an urgent unmet need for new treatments for fungal infections which increasingly impact immuno-compromised patients who are at high risk of contracting these difficult-to-treat, and often deadly, infections,' said Mike Grey, president and CEO of Amplyx Pharmaceuticals. 'There hasn't been a new class of antifungal drug approved since 2001, and many existing antifungal agents are difficult to use, often poorly tolerated or ineffective due to the rise of drug resistant strains.'\n\n\n\nIn association with the financing, Niall O'Donnell, Ph.D., managing director, RiverVest Venture Partners, and Ed Mathers, partner, New Enterprise Associates, were named to Amplyx's board of directors.\n\n\n\nThe following management team has been retained to lead the company, and will join Amplyx founder and chief scientific officer, Mitchell Mutz, Ph.D., as well as a number of experienced antifungal/drug development experts:\n\n\n\nMike Grey, president and CEO, is a venture partner with Pappas Ventures. He was previously president and CEO of Lumena Pharmaceuticals, acquired by Shire in 2014.\n\nCiara Kennedy, Ph.D., chief operating officer, joins Amplyx from Shire where she was vice president, head of cholestatic liver disease. Dr. Kennedy previously led the clinical development programs she initiated as chief operating officer, Lumena Pharmaceuticals.\n\nSusan Dube, vice president, business development and administration, was previously vice president of corporate development at Lumena Pharmaceuticals before its acquisition by Shire.\n\n'Several members of Amplyx's management team have worked together previously on a number of successful ventures and have the vital experience necessary to execute the clinical development of APX001, including leadership in obtaining multiple drug approvals,' said Dr. O'Donnell. 'The combination of this seasoned management team with great working relationships and a promising asset in a space with significant unmet need makes Amplyx a highly attractive company.'\n\n\n\nThe company will be eligible to pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway for APX001 under the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, which provides Fast-Track and priority FDA review of a qualified infectious disease product, as well as potential market authorization in the U.S. with a limited clinical trial database. The GAIN Act also extends the period of regulatory exclusivity by five years during which antifungals that treat serious or life-threatening infections can be sold without generic competition.\n\n\n\n'APX001 has the potential to transform the antifungal treatment landscape by providing a much needed tool to address some of the most deadly and hard-to-treat fungal infections which impact more than 600,000 patients worldwide each year,' said Mr. Mathers. 'The combination of a potentially transformational therapy with a winning team that has previously successfully executed is a recipe for a great potential return on our investment.'\n\n\n\nAbout RiverVest\n\nRiverVest Venture Partners focuses exclusively on innovations in life sciences, a field in which our team has significant research, clinical, operational and investment expertise.

{"text": "London-based Medbelle raises €6 million to build the world’s first digital hospital.\n\nLondon-based medtech startup Medbelle is building the world’s first digital hospital, supporting patients through every step, from signup to aftercare. Its platform and app provide comprehensive information about treatments, prices, financing options, consultations, medical details, and appointments. Over 30,000 Britons have already used the service, and the founders expect to attract an additional 144,000 users by 2020.\n\nFounded in 2016, the end-to-end platform for medical procedures has just announced €6 million in Series A funding to accelerate the digitisation of the patient journey. The round was led by signals Venture Capital, with participation from Talis Capital, Mutschler Ventures, IBB Beteiligungsgesellschaft, and Cavalry Ventures.\n\n“Major digital platforms improve customer experience in almost all industries, however, in healthcare, the digitisation of patient journeys has been heavily lagging behind until now,” said Clemens Koós, investment manager at signals Venture Capital. “Medbelle’s technology and personalised care enable much simpler and more affordable medical treatments – while allowing healthcare providers to efficiently focus on treating patients. We look forward to working with the Medbelle team and co-investors in expanding the platform to include more treatment specialities and increasing its reach.”\n\nMedbelle’s three-layered ‘digital hospital’ model (including the Medbelle Platform, Medbelle Care, and Medbelle Operating System) puts control in the hands of patients, and gives healthcare professionals access to an integrated suite of management tools covering the entire treatment journey – from first consultation to billing, post-operative care and follow-up.\n\nPatients can book their procedure through Medbelle, which provides them with leading specialists and state-of-the-art operating facilities – with all of the details taken care of by the platform. The Medbelle service is designed to save patients time, stress and money, ensuring that they benefit from the very best treatments and facilities available. Once a patient is registered, every aspect of their treatment is accessible via a single, simple web portal and app, or through their own personal Medbelle Care Adviser.\n\nAt the same time, the Medbelle Operating System ensures healthcare providers can make the most of their valuable time and resources. It allows specialists, hospitals and staff to work more productively, and liberates them from inefficient, unnecessary administrative tasks.\n\nThe investment will enable Medbelle to undertake the next phase of its roll-out. And with the UK private healthcare sector forecast to hit $13.8 billion by 2023, it’s a market opportunity that has proven highly attractive to investors.\n\nIn its launch phase, Medbelle was focused on privately-paid procedures in areas such as cosmetics, bariatrics, and ophthalmology, and is currently expanding into orthopaedics and fertility. In the future, Medbelle will work with private medical and public insurance providers and the NHS to leverage its technology and services to help patients with all types of medical procedures.\n\n“The new capital will accelerate the development of our platform while growing Medbelle’s operating footprint,” said Daniel Kolb, co-founder and MD of Medbelle. “It will allow us to streamline high-quality care at scale and take even more work off the hospitals’ and specialists’ shoulders. Our technology helps them to operate more efficiently, be better-utilised and fully focused on what matters most: the best care for patients.”\n\n“The digital health market is expected to reach $536 billion by 2025 – so the time is right to be focusing on technologies that can transform healthcare and the patient journey as we know it today,” added Vasile Foca, Managing Partner at Talis Capital. “We’re proud to be backing Leander, Daniel and their high-quality team in this latest round as they roll out their truly digital treatment solution. Medbelle is the world’s first digital hospital that creates real value for both patients and providers and offers unrivalled care from some of the country’s best specialists.”\n\nBy the way: If you’re interested to join a fast-growing startup like Medbelle, make sure to check out the EU-Startups Job Board.", "entities": [[0, 6, "headquarters_loc"], [13, 21, "org_in_focus"], [29, 39, "money_funded"], [86, 92, "headquarters_loc"], [115, 123, "org_in_focus"], [523, 527, "year_founded"], [595, 605, "money_funded"], [609, 617, "type_of_funding"], [710, 725, "investor"], [751, 764, "investor"], [766, 784, "investor"], [786, 814, "investor"], [820, 836, "investor"]]}
{"text": "Facebook for Tots and Tweens PixyKids Rebrands to Kazaana, Launches Beta.\n\nPreviously, we covered startup PixyKids’ pre-launch funding, and now the social network for the younger demographic is ready for public access. The site is officially launching in public beta today, as well as introducing its new name and brand: Kazaana, From an Indian term meaning “treasure,” the new name is supposed to evoke the creative and sharing tools around the network, as well as just be a fun-sounding word for kids to use. Co-founder and CEO Rajul Kadakia told BetaKit that she’s also hoping it will convey the value of the network to parents and other older family members.\n\n“We’re a family-centric platform, versus just a kid-centric platform,” she said in an interview. “PixyKids didn’t really encompass the whole family, it was just about kids, and that’s not really who we are, so we decided to take a name that was a little more encompassing.”\n\nDespite the about-face with the name, the site is still sticking to its original mission: to provide a space for kids, parents and other close relatives to come together and share experiences. The startup has done extensive market testing to make sure that’s what Kazaana provides, which is why the platform is based around a core set of launch features designed to appeal to all the things kids love to get out of their digital experiences.\n\nThose features include the ability to create and interact via 3D avatars that bear a fair resemblance to popular PC and console video game title The Sims, video chat similar to Skype, and also virtual spaces kids can “own” and decorate. According to Kadakia, they found while creating Kazaana that these kinds of customization features where what kids were looking for, more so even than social factors, in an online virtual shared space.\n\n“3D avatars and customization ranked number one in our tests above everything, even all the social features,” she said. “They really like them, and even with all the ones we have, they’re asking for more. That’s why we’re working on more now.” Kadakia points to the success of 3D avatars on consoles, such as the Wii’s Mii and Xbox avatars, as examples of how that’s been popular elsewhere among younger users.\n\nIt’s that focus on customization that will help Kazaana remain unique and attractive even if Facebook begins to target younger users, as a recent WSJ article claimed they could. Also, Kadakia believes her network’s strong focus on security, which has earned it a number of privacy certifications from organizations, like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, will help it stand apart from Facebook, which bases much of its business model around gathering information associated with its users and using that for marketing purposes.\n\nKazaana still might face an uphill climb, since it wants to both convince kids that it’s a great place to hang out and socialize, as well as keep parents and relatives in the loop about what they’re doing. But especially for the younger kids, it should provide a simpler way to connect than via existing, business-focused tools like Skype. Also, the startup is planning the introduction of additional features, including a mobile app that Kadakia described as somewhat like Instagram for kids, which also allows them to view their social feed from the site. Native mobile apps should also help with reach, which is what Kazaana will need plenty of in order to execute on its monetization strategies down the road, which center on virtual currency and goods to drive revenue.", "entities": []}

Pavilion’s small, fast, simple and purpose-built platform provides the performance of direct-attached storage with the flexibility, manageability, and economics of shared storage for modern rack-scale applications.\n\nPavilion Data also announced its second round of funding, bringing the company’s total funding to $33 million. The company is welcoming two new investors: Korea Investment Partners and DAG Ventures. Existing investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Artiman Ventures and SK Telecom also participated in this round. The company will use the additional financing to expand its global customer base, increase its product offering, and accelerate sales and marketing efforts.\n\n“In order to deliver continuously increasing customer expectations, we must identify and adopt transformative technologies that improve application performance while lowering costs,” said Keith Martin, director, Cloud Capacity Engineering at ServiceNow. “Pavilion Data’s high-density, low-latency NVMe-oF storage array is an innovative solution, and we are evaluating the potential performance, management and cost advantages that it represents to our current infrastructure.”\n\n“Pavilion Data’s bold and innovative approach to solving globally pervasive rack-scale storage problems embodies the game-changing approach Korea Investment Partners (KIP) seeks out,” said Songwoo Lee, president and executive director of Korea Investment Partners.

With its offices in Graz, Vienna, San Francisco, Shanghai and Shenzhen, USound serves international customers, enabling them to create totally new smart audio applications with MEMS speakers.\n\n“We come to total funding of $30 million. Most of the money comes from private investors in Austria”, says the USound CEO, Ferrucio Bottoni, Trending Topics reported. “The production takes place in Austria and Italy. So far, we have produced about 100,000 pieces. The production of the small speakers will now be ramped up. The second generation of MEMS speakers is already on track. We’ve been working on the second generation for more than a year”, says Bottoni.\n\nThe new chip is even smaller, cheaper to produce and uses even less power, he added.\n\n“Our main application right now is in-ear headphones and wireless headphones, but also augmented-reality glasses,” says Bottoni noting that in the future, they also want their product to be installed in smartphones or tablets.\n\nAccording to the company, the soon available next-generation loudspeakers will integrate an innovative energy recovery audio amplifier resulting in the most advanced and compact micro audio system on the market. It will remarkably cutback the power consumption of the device allowing up to 12 hours of battery life for applications like true wireless earbuds and other wearable devices. The new MEMS speakers with the energy recovery amplifier will be available from Q3 2019 for selected customers.\n\nFounded also in 2014, eQventure, on the other hand, provides Austrian companies besides growth capital a strong network as well as straightforward support in all situations from ramping up companies up to restructuring whole enterprises.

{"text": "How government regulators can better embrace the sharing economy.\n\nWhere governments step in, entrepreneurship tends to die.\n\n\n\nIn the early days of co-founding GoFetch, I have learned that traditional commerce is only at the beginning of a dramatic change led by the upstart of companies leveraging the sharing economy. Other sharing economy companies like Airbnb and Uber blur the lines between our personal and professional lives, creating uncertain territory for business owners, consumers and governments. For now, the sharing economy is a highly unregulated part of business. Eventually, that could change. But what regulation looks like — as well as who actually creates and enforces regulations — is also bound to change.\n\nLet’s look at three real-world examples of how governments are trying to influence regulation in the fast-paced world of online marketplaces.\n\nTaxing Airbnb hosts and why it won’t fix the rental problems cities are facing\n\nAirbnb is notorious for fighting government regulations in the cities they operate in. Airbnb allows many people to supplement their income and pay their bills, being incredibly attractive in expensive cities like San Francisco and Vancouver. Regulators believe in order to decrease rental rates and increase vacancy rates, making their respective cities more ‘liveable’, the need to tax hosts on Airbnb – this is simply flawed thinking.\n\nFor instance, in Vancouver, where GoFetch is headquartered and Uber is banned, there are about 5,000 Airbnb listings. City permit red tape is holding up the development of an astronomically larger amount than 5,000 housing units in Vancouver. Strata by-laws already allow local communities to enforce rules such as the frequency of rental allowed within their building and fine/enforce as they deem appropriate within the boundaries of the law.\n\nAirbnb distributes tourist dollars more evenly among city residents versus a couple of hotel corporations receiving the majority of the benefit. City residents who use Airbnb generally do not pay the city a hotel tax as hotels do. Taxing Airbnb units like hotels are taxed would effectively be a tax increase on the residents of cities they are hosts in. In theory, this money could be funneled into affordable housing initiatives (assuming priority). There is a highly limited supply of hotel and short term housing in Vancouver and Airbnb is meeting that need. Being an attractive tourist destination is tremendously beneficial to the local economy and Airbnb is a major part of that.\n\nWhy Uber really merged with Didi\n\nLast week, Uber announced it was selling its operation in China to a major rival ride-sharing company, Didi Chuxing. The merger presents many positives for Uber, however I still think Uber leaving China is not because of the head-butting with their rivals but because of head-butting with the state. At first entry into China, Uber needed to change its core product to adhere to payment regulations and mapping services. Uber added Alipay so Chinese customers could actually sign up for the service and partnered with Baidu so they could leverage their mapping tech (Google Maps is notoriously inaccurate in China).\n\nIn the end, it was not because of Didi that Uber needed to leave China, it was the growing national regulations – regulations that were being written while Didi and Uber were in merger talks.\n\nLet’s take a deeper look:\n\nOn 28 July, China announces new regulations for cab-hailing services.\n\n48 working hours later, Uber decides to sell out its Chinese business to Didi Chuxing to create a cab-hailing company with over 90% market share.\n\nI don’t believe this is a coincidence.\n\nAssuming these events are related, then a government facilitated the creation of a monopoly in China.\n\nChina has demonstrated that it will not allow foreign companies to control its vital assets — in this case, the asset is potentially their online ecosystem. This is not new for western tech giants: eBay, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, the list goes on.\n\nAnd why not? What China has essentially done is that it has created a giant utility out of Didi-Uber, a near monopoly, highly regulated—yet driven by the profit margin.\n\nPerhaps one of the most successful VCs, Paul Graham, can summarize better than me:\n\nGoing forward, Uber can now save $1 billion per year (their reported Chinese operating costs), focus on new markets such as India (where more regulatory issues face them), and answer less questions surrounding profitability (I’m assuming they are profitable now in most of the US markets). In selling their operations to China, Uber gets to leave China in good hands and at a good price.\n\nThousands of users, zero employees\n\nPersonally, I look at the above illustrations as a macro-example of what will be a long and hard war – not only for Uber and Airbnb, but every high-growth startup innovating in a traditional marketplace that has never seen massive disruption, very similar to what GoFetch is doing to the pet services category.\n\nWatching the big battles that Uber and Airbnb have faced so far, we see a group of innovative entrepreneurs come along offering a new service that breaks old rules, ignoring the traditional rules until they re-write them; and governments and traditional corporations attempt to strangle innovation and shut down the new disruption.\n\nAs an entrepreneur myself, I believe this is a mindset that marketplaces can follow for a less bumpy road in the future. It’s the way that marketplace startups regulate themselves.\n\nSharing economy startups might offer innovative approaches to not only their own regulation challenges, but to unresolved regulation challenges that predate their rise.\n\nIn sum, the main goal of marketplaces like Airbnb and GoFetch is to create a regulated community of strangers to do business with each other, quickly, and at scale. Because of the vast amount of consumer data that marketplaces receive, we have opened the doors to collaborate on an agreement with regulators. Here’s how: first, regulators and government need to be open to new models and disruption of traditional categories such as travel and competition, opening the door to innovation, testing, and learning for entrepreneurs and startups.\n\nIn exchange for this, marketplace companies need to share their untampered user data with government regulators, just as their customers do with them. This gives us the freedom to experience the obvious benefits of marketplace startups, while giving governments better understanding of the real positives that come because of them.\n\nPut differently, sharing economy startups might offer innovative approaches to not only their own regulation challenges, but to unresolved regulation challenges that predate their rise.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nEveryone from venture capitalists to consumers realize that the sharing economy is too big an opportunity to miss. Governments also see that it’s too risky to ignore. Like all major disruptions, marketplace startups are challenging regulatory incumbents with new business models and new ways of engaging customers. Existing regulators will need to embrace companies like Uber and Airbnb and transform their boundaries to meet consumer demand, or find themselves disrupted by those who do embrace this shift.", "entities": []}

Ugandan co-working space Outbox is running a free 12-week course to train female participants in programming and entrepreneurship, while in South Africa codeX launched a free two-week bootcamp to encourage young women to take up coding.\n\nSilicon Cape recently hosted a TechWomen networking conference in Cape Town, while at a more international level Silicon Valley-based incubator Blackbox is hosting an accelerator exclusively for female entrepreneurs, US State-Department funded TechWomen is taking individuals into a new cohort of its exchange programme, and She Leads Africa has partnered with Intel to run a series of workshops in Africa targeting young female developers and tech entrepreneurs.\n\nOwigar said AkiraChix played a positive role in Kenya by supporting young female entrepreneurs, who already faced the usual challenges of running startup businesses in Africa.\n\n“Running a startup in Africa is pretty difficult in general. Access to funding is limited, in some cases the market is not mature or ready for the product, it’s hard to do market research,” she said.\n\n“As an entrepreneur I experience all these challenges. As a woman I have been lucky to run Akirachix with a group of co-founders who are female just as I am. This has provided a lot of support, especially during the early days when we were the only ones who believed in our vision. I believe that since I had a support group I had a much easier experience that many entrepreneurs.”\n\nOwigar said AkiraChix had initially experienced some skepticism from men as it was an initiative for women in a male-dominated field.\n\n“But over the course of the years many men have become champions of our initiative since it benefits the whole community,” she said.\n\n“Another important thing to note is that our main customers and beneficiaries are women, and the funders we work with are out to champion women’s issues. So we work in an area where we always have supporters around us. The key has been to align ourselves with people who support our vision.”", "entities": []}

Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nFrom idea to startup\n\nTwice a year ACE Venture lab organizes the bootcamp, which is a fully sponsored training program that is open to everybody: students, researchers and industry professionals. The bootcamp offers workshops and mentoring from startup experts that helps startups convert ideas into successful businesses. Lead mentor for this round was Gigi Wang, an industry fellow at UC Berkeley’s Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Board Member & Chair Emeritus of the MITEF / Standford Venture Lab (VLAB).\n\nDiverse\n\nThe startups that presented their ideas and business plans at the demo day were very diverse. There were the typical stuttering students that had trouble getting their unique selling point across, two professors in Molecular Neuroscience that had the key to better medicine for Parkinson patients and, like always it seems, a startup that developed yet another travel app.\n\nZazu\n\nDuring Zazu’s pitch, it became clear the team was working on something special: an e-mail based on-demand service that operates as your own personal assistant. No apps or plugins are needed: the user simply adds Zazu in the cc field of their e-mail program when a meeting is being scheduled. Through AI and machine learning, Zazu takes care of the rest and informs you where you need to be, and when.\n\nMinor program\n\nZazu originated during the minor Entrepreneurship at the University of Amsterdam Business School. “As part of this minor we had five months to set up our own business,” says Megan van Doorn, commercial director of the company. “We felt that the products already offered on the market did not satisfy the needs of scheduling meetings. We wanted to create a product that is fully automated and takes over the hassle that is involved when setting up a meeting. “\n\nPlatform free\n\nZazu doesn’t need an app or plug in and is completely platform free. According to van Doorn, people are getting tired of having to download an app for everything. “There are countless app’s these days, and people are obliged to download numerous applications on their phone, tablet and so on. The beauty of our product is; it’s no app, no web service, and no download. It integrates on the system that you are already using and familiar with, making it convenient to implement the product for the user. You only need to register and we take over the rest. In addition to this, it is easily usable for anyone and anywhere, since you just e-mail like you normally would.”\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nWorking through the cc field of an e-mail program proved to be a difficult task for the team, but the real difficulty lies in the AI-aspect of the system. “It is a very complex problem and needs a lot of research and data along with competent algorithms. Artificial intelligence is a new understanding, there are countless new developments in the sector that we want to incorporate. We are ought to work very accurately to ensure a safe and optimal working product by merging these new techniques.”\n\nZazu is currently in the process of developing the AI-based personal assistant. The coming year they will fully focus on the development of the product and growing the business. Van Doorn: “We want to launch our product in the market and collaborate with big partners to stimulate this growth. In a year’s time we want our product to be fully operational and be able to serve our first target group.”", "entities": []}

{"text": "Virtual School Puts the Power of Basic Education Back into the Hands of Every Learner, Teacher and Parent in South Africa.\n\nJOHANNESBURG, South Africa–(BUSINESS WIRE)–September 12, 2014–\n\nIn partnership with Mxit Reach and UNICEF, the South African Education Ministry today proudly launched the Ukufunda Virtual School, a program utilizing both smartphones and feature phones to deliver high-quality education to the underserved, rural corners of South Africa.\n\nUkufunda, which means “learn to grow and grow to learn” in Zulu, will promote equitable access to quality learning and teaching, enable professional development of teachers, and support curriculum delivery – all through the revolutionary use of mobile phones.\n\nWith the support of Mxit, the South African-born mobile social networking platform, Ukufunda seeks to address a problem inherent in many other virtual schools today: namely that most mobile-enabled educational technology requires access to the web or smart devices. In South Africa, as in many parts of the world, access to the web and ownership of a smart device is beyond the reach of those who need education the most. Because Mxit can function in areas where only 2G connectivity is available and on over 8,000 devices – on everything from feature phones to smartphones and tablets – the benefits of the virtual school are no longer restricted to smartphone users.\n\n“The Ukufunda Virtual School will directly address inequalities in the school system, raise education standards and put the power of basic education back into the hands of every learner, teacher and parent,” says Mr. Enver Surty, Deputy Minister of Basic Education in South Africa.\n\nFounded in 2005, Mxit is a South African mobile social network with millions of active users monthly. Because Mxit is incredibly data-light – thanks to a unique compression algorithm to control data consumption and lower costs – users are able to spend more time chatting, learning, or just socializing in as many as 22 different languages.\n\n“We believe that one of our most important roles is to act as a technology conduit, linking experts such as the Department of Basic Education and UNICEF and their content and services with the people who need it most,” says Andrew Rudge, CEO of Mxit Reach.\n\n“We are excited to be part of such a meaningful project. Ukufunda doesn’t only provide free access to great educational content, but is rather a holistic approach to learner and teacher wellbeing, focusing on psychosocial support, safety and wellness. It’s a giant leap forward in improving lines of communication and linking all stakeholders,” comments Ms. Nadi Albino, Chief of Education, UNICEF South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa has an estimated mobile phone penetration rate of 228%*, which suggests that most teachers, parents, and a substantial number of learners, are likely to have access to mobile services. The learner section of Ukufunda currently includes the following services:\n\nMy Calendar – Notification of tasks and events\n\n– Notification of tasks and events My Educational Resources – Links to textbooks and reference material\n\n– Links to textbooks and reference material My Safety and Wellness – Links to counselling and emergency services\n\n– Links to counselling and emergency services My Groups – Virtual communities of practice\n\nThe next phase of the Virtual School will include a section for My Homework, assisting learners to complete homework assignments, and My Mentor, a yearlong mentorship that matches learners with either working professionals or tertiary students.\n\n“A good school doesn’t just have excellent teachers, it also has a great supportive environment – there are counsellors to deal with psychosocial issues, experts to guide career choices, and leadership courses to develop well-rounded individuals. Ukufunda provides all of these and more,” concludes Mr. Enver Surty, Deputy Minister of Basic Education.\n\n*GSMA: Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa 2013\n\nMxit\n\nDave Luis\n\nMedia Manager\n\nMobile: +27 (0)71 129 0903\n\ndave@mxit.com\n\nor\n\nBen-Carl Havemann\n\nMarketing & Communications Manager\n\nMobile: +27 (0)82 872 4208\n\nbc@mxit.com\n\nor\n\nDepartment of Basic Education, South Africa\n\nElijah Mhlanga, +27 (0)12 357 3773\n\nActing Chief Director: Media Liaison – National and Provincial Communication\n\nMobile: +27 (0)83 580 8275\n\nMhlanga.E@dbe.gov.za\n\nor\n\nUNICEF\n\nBen-Albert Smith\n\nCommunication Officer at UNICEF South Africa\n\nMobile: +27 (0) 0715080801\n\nbsmith@unicef.org\n\nor\n\nRacepoint Global (U.S. Contact)\n\nAndra Searles, +1 202-517-1381\n\nAssistant Account Executive\n\nasearles@racepointglobal.com", "entities": []}

{"text": "Standard Bank leads $4m investment round in SA fintech Nomanini [Updated].\n\nUPDATE (27 August 2019): We neglected to mention in the initial version of this story that Dutch impact investor Goodwell Investments also participated in the $4-million round. The story has been amended to reflect this.\n\nSA fintech company Nomanini has netted $4-million (about R61-million) in an investment round led by Standard Bank, with participation from Amsterdam-based investment firm Goodwell Investments, the Cape Town based fintech company announced today.\n\nBoth investors have taken an undisclosed stake in the company.\n\nNomanini, which was founded in 2010 by Vahid Monadjem (pictured above) who serves as the company’s CEO, connects informal merchants with distributors via an e-wallet and physical device. Merchants can use the same device to offer basic banking services to their communities.\n\nThe fintech company said in a statement today that by investing in the company, Standard Bank will be able to use Nomanini’s platform to collect data on the informal retail economy.\n\nStandard Bank has invested $4m in return for an undisclosed stake in Nomanini\n\nThis will allow the bank to offer a mobile application which provides access to new lines of business, credit and savings services for millions of informal merchants across the continent, the fintech said.\n\n“Transaction data analysis via Nomanini’s platform means that micro-merchants’ creditworthiness can be more accurately assessed and, as a result, many will become eligible for working capital loans for the first time.\n\n“For the merchants using this service, this means a boost to ongoing trade, increased return customers and the sale of additional goods and services,” the fintech said.\n\n14 African countries by 2021\n\nNomanini aims to roll the service out across 14 African countries by early 2021 — including in South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, eSwatini and Lesotho.\n\nNomanini head of communications Kim Humby explained that the 14 countries fall in Standard Bank’s African footprint.\n\nIn an article earlier today SA financial publication Moneyweb quoted Adrian Vermooten, Standard Bank’s head of digital in Africa regions, who said by using Nomanini technology, Standard Bank will be able to collect for example data on pre-paid airtime, which would enable the bank to build up a financial profile on each retailer.\n\nMonadjem, who is a trained engineer and former McKinsey & Company’s global fellow for Emerging Market Product Development, is quoted in the same report as saying that Nomanini is open to partnerships with other banks elsewhere, but that its partnership with Standard Bank will keep the fintech company busy for very long time.\n\n$1.1m raised previously\n\nAccording to Crunchbase figures, the fintech previously raised a total of $1.1-million in funding over three rounds.\n\nIt’s unclear whether this figure is accurate, as the amount in investment was not disclosed by any of the parties in the last two of these three rounds.\n\nThe company’s latest investment follows their last funding round in 2015, when the company raised an undisclosed amount from Goodwell Investments (see this story).\n\nIn 2014 it raised an undisclosed amount in Series-B funding from Seychelles-based investment company Rockbridge Investments Limited (see this story) — after Netherlands based eVentures Africa Fund and angel investor Esther Dyson in 2012 invested $600 000 in the company (see this story).\n\nNomanini’s Humby told Ventureburn in an email today that the fintech has 17 employees and recently opened offices in Johannesburg and Lusaka.\n\nShe said Cape Town is the company’s product and development centre, while Johannesburg hosts its commercial, operations and finance teams. Lusaka has a small regional sales team, she added.\n\nHumby said despite a decision to launch the product first in East Africa, the company is “not specifically” targeting East Africa.\n\nRead more: SA payments platform Nomanini selected as MIT awards finalist, nets $35 000\n\nRead more: Nomanini raises fresh funding round from impact investment firm Goodwell\n\nRead more: Nomanini secures Series-B bringing total capital raised to over R20-million\n\nRead more: Prepaid voucher business-in-a-box Nomanini raises series-A funding", "entities": [[0, 13, "investor"], [20, 23, "money_funded"], [44, 46, "headquarters_loc"], [55, 63, "org_in_focus"], [84, 98, "date_of_funding"], [189, 209, "investor"], [235, 251, "money_funded"], [298, 300, "headquarters_loc"], [317, 325, "org_in_focus"], [337, 347, "money_funded"], [355, 366, "money_funded"], [398, 411, "investor"], [469, 489, "investor"], [495, 504, "headquarters_loc"], [537, 542, "date_of_funding"], [609, 617, "org_in_focus"], [640, 644, "year_founded"]]}
{"text": "GSF Bullish On Deeptech, Invests $1 Mn In Four Startups.\n\nTech accelerator GSF has announced its sixth batch as part of which four deeptech startups graduated this week with a collective investment of $1 Mn (INR 7.22 Cr). The startups’ focus ranged from manufacturing technology, vernacular content, and AI-driven sales analytics, to deep learning, legal tech, and fintech.\n\n“These four startups are at the seed stage and have innovative solutions with paying customers. Our global ecosystem of mentors, advisors, investors and EiRs (Entrepreneurs in Residence) have helped these four startups over the last six months,” Rajesh Sawhney, founder of GSF Accelerator said. Sawhney is also the cofounder of Gastrotope, a Gurugram-based agrifood startup accelerator.\n\nGSF Accelerator commenced the sixth batch in December 2017. It offers $200K (INR 1.4 Cr) to the selected startups. Additionally, it invests $1 Mn (INR 7.22 Cr) as co-investments in seed/Series A rounds at the end of the programme.\n\nThe GSF 6.0 investment team includes eminent investors such as Rajesh Sawhney; Hiro Mashita, founder of M&S Partners, Singapore; Anand Chandrasekaran, now driving Facebook Messenger platform and ex-CPO of Snapdeal; Sumesh Menon, founder of Utopia Mobile; Dinesh Agarwal, founder of Indiamart; Ashish Toshniwal, founder of Y Media Labs, San Francisco; Sri Peddu, founder of Powerhouse Ventures; Murugavel Janakiraman, founder and CEO Matrimony.com; and Boris Ryabov, Bright Capital.\n\nAs part of this multi-country programme, the startups selected in the sixth batch have been mentored by top founders, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs in Bengaluru and have recently completed an immersion programme in the Silicon Valley. Next, they will visit China and Japan for exposure to the investment and startup communities in these countries.\n\nMeet The Four Startups From GSF Sixth Batch\n\nChizel: Chizel is a cloud platform that offers a convenient way to manufacture engineering components. The platform employs self-learning AI algorithms that harness the full potential of digitally connected machines to provide complete manufacturing solutions to the customers.\n\nKhabri: A fast-growing digital platform for vernacular audio content, the Khabri mobile app allows content creators to create channels and programmes and reach millions of vernacular listeners across India and overseas.\n\nSlintel: It is a technographics-powered discovery and AI driven recommendation platform helping companies improve their sales conversion rates by predicting who their next customer would be.\n\nVaultedge: It is a smart AI platform that helps banks and business processing outsourcing organisations perform loan underwriting and contract abstraction in real time.\n\nGSF Accelerator: Six Years, 50 Funded Startups\n\nStarted in 2012, the GSF Network has three components — an accelerator, an angel network, and tech conferences. As of November 2017, it claimed to have funded 50 startups in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. Along the way, it has also made successful exits from 10 of these startups.\n\nGSF has a strong track record of success with its portfolio companies. Some of its portfolio companies are Little Eye Labs (acquired by Facebook), Pokkt, SilverPush, Zapr, HackerEarth, Flintobox, Timesaverz, Dailyrounds, DocsApp, Whatfix, and Quiziz.\n\nAround 50% of the companies incubated by GSF Network have managed to raise VC-led investment rounds, while over 90% have secured seed funding.\n\nEarlier, in June this year, GSF announced a new accelerator programme focused on fintech and is looking for startups and founders who think they can disrupt the financial industry in India. As a part of the programme, GSF will invest up to $200K (INR 1.4 Cr) in the most promising startups.\n\nAlso, in April 2018, it announced an entry into the education space with the launch of Indiginus by GSF. The mission is to help mainstream consumer companies and employees gain skills in digital innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship. Indiginus will also incubate select startups in the education and talent space.\n\nDeeptech: AI, ML And Big Data Next Big Thing In India\n\nAccording to The State Of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report by Inc42 in November 2018, India ranked third in the global AI ecosystem, with deeptech startups bagging 5% of the total funding in 2017.\n\nWith VCs having concerns about the long gestation period between the idea stage and first cash flow, incubators and accelerators are playing a prominent role in aiding deeptech startups.\n\nThis year, NASSCOM also announced Accelerate 10X as part of its NASSCOM 10000 Startups initiative to help 100 mature-stage deeptech startups each year with mentoring and funding.\n\nAt the same time, the increasing shutdowns in the sector are a matter of concern. As per Inc42’s Ecosystem report, so far the deeptech segment has seen 74 shutdowns, most of them due to a dearth of funding.\n\nHowever, with the success of startups like Ather Energy, GreyOrange, IdeaForge, among others, VCs such as pi Ventures are focusing purely on the deeptech sector. This indicates that the segment is expected to pick up the pace in the coming years.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Fincheck acquires stake in FundingHub, takes over management of platform.\n\nFincheck — a SA startup that allows consumers to compare financial services products — has taken an undisclosed minority stake in FundingHub and has also assumed full management of the platform.\n\nA statement by Fincheck earlier today claimed that the transaction makes Fincheck the country’s biggest financial comparison site as well as the biggest lead aggregator having signed on 71 banks, lenders and insurers.\n\nFundingHub helps refer South African small businesses looking for finance to 30 alternative lenders and banks.\n\nNeither Fincheck CEO Michael Bowren (pictured above) nor FundingHub co-founder Marilynn Leonard — who is from Xpertek Group, the company that founded FundingHub two years ago — would disclose the value of the transaction or size of the stake that Fincheck has taken.\n\nHowever, Leonard was able to say that based on agreed milestones it reaches, Fincheck will be able to increase its stake in FundingHub.\n\nFincheck’s investment in FundingHub is the second investment the platform has concluded since its launch in 2017\n\nShe said currently four people work for the platform.\n\nLeonard said the Xpertek Group, a holding company with a portfolio of five software companies, was founded in 2003 to offer payment switching as well as lending systems to lenders to manage their loans books.\n\nLeonard explained that it was from this that the idea for FundingHub had come about.\n\nShe said it made sense to work with Fincheck — which was founded by Bowren and Chris Ball in 2016 — as the two platforms’ offerings complement one another.\n\nShe said FundingHub was initially funded by a private investor, Paul Kent. She however declined to say how much or what stake Kent had taken in the company.\n\nBowen, who said Fincheck has seven employees at present, told Ventureburn that his company took over managing the platform last month.\n\nThe management of the platform forms part of the deal and is not in exchange for additional management fees from FundingHub’s main shareholders the Xpertek Group, he stressed.\n\nHe said the deal came about after the growth of Fincheck’s personal finance comparison, when the two were looking to partner with a platform that helps refer business owners to funders.\n\n“Fincheck had grown and done quite well so it was a natural conversation,” he added.\n\nFincheck will continue to offer its core offering — which allows consumers to get various personal finance comparisons — via MyFincheck.\n\n‘Average loans sizes of R300 000’\n\nIn an earlier press release Fincheck’s Bowren said FundingHub had attracted average loan sizes of R300 000, with the largest loan being R72-million.\n\nHe said FundingHub allows small businesses to apply in under six minutes for business finance, comparing multiple accredited finance providers and to make the most appropriate choice based on their business needs.\n\n“There are many different forms of finance available to SMEs. This makes it difficult for them to choose which lender is best suited to their business needs.\n\n“For instance, a business may not know whether it needs equipment finance, unsecured or secured term loans, overdrafts, lines of credit, debtor finance, merchant cash advances or credit cards,” he said.\n\nSmall businesses that apply for funding on FundingHub need to have been in business for a minimum of 12 months and need to have an annual turnover of at least R1-million.\n\nOnce the small business completes the application, one of FundingHub’s lenders will make an offer. The small business is able to apply to more than one lender and select the most suitable.\n\nThree percent commission from financiers\n\nBowen told Ventureburn that FundingHub takes a commission of three percent on the value of each loan from each financier that gets a referral through the platform.\n\nHowever, he stressed that the inclusion of the commission fee does not necessarily mean the finance is then priced to take this into consideration — by the financier for example recouping the cost of the commission paid by charging higher interest rates. Commission payments could come from the marketing budget of each financier, he said.\n\nWhile he agreed that the finance offered by alternative lenders via FundingHub is typically more expensive than what banks generally charge, he said this is dependent on the sector that a small business client operates in.\n\nWhile funders such as fintechs and others that provide alternative finance may have helped increase the options small businesses can tap to access finance, banks are still able to provide finance far more affordably.\n\nThe answer may then lie in expanding the offering to more banks. Currently FundingHub has signed up only Investec Bank and Nedbank.\n\nBowren agreed that this is something that the platform is considering. “We’d like to get all the banks on board,” he added.\n\nUntil this happens, SA financiers may carry on creaming it from small businesses.\n\nRead more: From banks to microlenders, Fincheck wants to help you find the best loans", "entities": []}

A common theme cites Segmint’s ability to drive growth through intelligent, personalized and secure communications across all channels using the banks’ own anonymized data.\n\nWith analytics at its core, the SegmintOne solution enables financial institutions to activate their own data and deliver 1-to-1 targeted messages, triggered in real time, in an authentic, secure way. It offers an end-to-end, predictive marketing solution that combines the complex functions of real-time customer data analytics, personalized message delivery, and campaign reporting into one easy-to-use tool.\n\nIn the past two quarters Segmint has signed 15 financial institutions through both direct efforts and via strategic reseller partners. The clients have ranged in size from global banking leaders with over $1 trillion in assets to small community banks with less than $500 million in assets.\n\nAll of these institutions will be leveraging the marketing analytics and real-time delivery solution to drive growth through intelligent cross-sell, new customer acquisition, greater customer engagement and overall increased marketing efficiencies. The solution delivers 1-to-1 targeted messages across all channels including the bank’s public and private sites, the branch and contact center as well as across millions of websites through the open internet via integration with real-time bidding networks.\n\n“The common thread among all of these forward thinking financial institutions is a clear vision for delivering a next generation banking experience steeped in rich analytics and real-time delivery,” said Rob Heiser, Segmint CEO and President. “KLIs are the DNA that serve as real-time triggers powering a more tailored experience that adapts dynamically to life events and delivers truly personalized messages to individuals. We are helping each one fulfill this vision.”\n\nFor 2016 and beyond, the combination of richer customer data analytics and real-time delivery is critical. “Better customer insights need to be turned into a set of experiences that are orchestrated for maximum impact,” according to a new Gartner report published January 19 titled, Data-Driven Marketing Primer for 2016. “These experiences should reflect near-real-time data and deliver a more personalized message.”\n\nThe SegmintOne patented solution assigns Key Lifestyle Indicators (KLIs) to each anonymized customer based on their products, activities and interests, channel preferences, competitive product mix, spending habits, among many other unique insights from a combination of predictive and real-time transactional behavior. With more than 500,000 possible KLIs, a typical customer has between 70 and 300 KLIs assigned to him or her.\n\nThe product leverages only anonymous data, never accepting any Personally Identifiable Information. Instead, Unique Customer Identification Codes (UCICs) are assigned to each customer to anonymize a financial institutions’ first-party data for increased security and privacy.\n\nFrom 90 to 120 days of delivering campaigns powered by SegmintOne, financial institutions on average experience a 108 percent increase in influenced cross-sell conversions, a 96 percent increase in influenced face value revenue, and a 53 percent reduction in the solution’s cost per product sold.

The latest funding round brings the total amount of capital raised by Zuora to $250 million. New investors include public-market investors Wellington Management Company LLP and Blackrock Inc., as well as PremjiInvest and Passport Capital. They join existing investors Benchmark Capital, Greylock Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Index Ventures, Shasta Ventures, Vulcan Capital, Next World Capital, Dave Duffield, co-founder and chairman of the board of Workday; and Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of salesforce.com -- all of whom participated in this latest funding round.\n\n\n\nZuora is one of the world's fastest-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Its relationship business management (RBM) platform allows companies to manage the entire lifecycle of the subscriber, including customer acquisition, recurring billing and payments, revenue recognition, and subscription metrics. With this new investment, Zuora will continue its global expansion into new geographies and vertical markets, expand its team with world-class sales, engineering and marketing personnel, and fuel continued research and development activities.\n\n\n\n'The Subscription Economy is permeating every industry -- entertainment, technology, healthcare, manufacturing with IoT, consumer products, everything,' said Tien Tzuo, Zuora co-founder and CEO. 'Customers are now subscribers, and the new way to acquire, bill, and nurture customers is through monetizing subscriber relationships.'\n\n\n\nTzuo continued, 'Our funding partners understand that this shift is creating a multibillion dollar opportunity for a new category of software that sits between traditional CRM and ERP. The lead investors, including Blackrock and Passport Capital, bring strategic experience to help Zuora meet the enormous opportunity in front of us.'\n\n\n\nMainstream Market Traction\n\nSince its founding in 2007, Zuora has correctly predicted the shift toward subscription-based business models and a transformation in the way business is transacted: from buying products to subscribing to services. Companies like salesforce.com, Amazon, Netflix, and Box were the vanguard of the subscription economy, but the story is now far broader and deeper, and relevant to nearly every industry.\n\n\n\nEnergy, retail, healthcare, education, consumer goods, financial services and telecom companies are seeking new approaches to commerce, billing and finance that will power these disruptive models and usher in the required business-process changes in line with a new era of customer engagement. Product professionals, sellers, marketers and finance professionals use Zuora to rethink how they engage, acquire, and nurture subscribers anywhere on the globe.\n\n\n\nCustomer Validation\n\n'Technology and digitization are helping Schneider Electric build deeper, more valuable customer relationships,' said HervÃ© Coureil, CIO of Schneider Electric. 'Zuora is helping us design and implement new go-to-market models that will fuel growth and long-term market advantage.'\n\n\n\n'Zuora has been our partner since day one, helping us scale -- from an early-stage startup to IPO -- and disrupt the content management and collaboration market,' said Aaron Levie, CEO of Box.\n\n\n\n'At HubSpot, we believe there is a fundamental mismatch between how organizations market and sell, and the way people actually shop and buy,' said Jim O'Neill, CIO of HubSpot. 'Subscription-based models help businesses grow, but also hold companies accountable for long-term value to their customers, which is something we care deeply about. Zuora helps make this possible.'\n\n\n\n'At Fairfax Media, we are shifting from a media company to a subscription company, allowing us to focus on building meaningful relationships with our subscriber base,' said Marc Thompson, GM of product solutions of Fairfax Media. 'In subscriptions, it's all about speed, agility and acquiring customers; Zuora and Salesforce helped us achieve our 12-month growth goals in just three months.'\n\n\n\nSignificant Growth in 2014\n\nCalendar 2014 marked a year of significant growth and expansion for Zuora. The company experienced a 109 percent year-over-year increase in invoice volume running through its systems; growth in contracted invoice volume to approximately $42 billion USD; strong international expansion with 106 percent year-over-year revenue growth internationally; opening of eight new offices worldwide; and an expansion of its total global workforce to 500 employees.\n\n\n\n'Companies are embracing the shift to subscription because they understand they must innovate or risk obsolescence,' said R. 'Ray' Wang, principal analyst and CEO, Constellation Research. 'While SaaS companies showed the way, this is just the beginning as every company now faces business model disruption. In a post-sales economy, the focus is not on selling products or services but on managing relationships and keeping the brand promise.'\n\n\n\n'Across many industries, the business of enabling experiences and nurturing relationships is augmenting or replacing product catalogs, shopping carts, and ownership,' said Amy Konary, research vice president at IDC. 'Success in this new world requires monetizing relationships instead of simply selling units. Zuora is playing a key role in enabling the shift to relationship business models.'\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n'The Subscription Economy: A Business Transformation' by Tien Tzuo, CEO of Zuora\n\nSlideShare: 'Drivers of Success in the Subscription Economy'\n\nFollow us online:\n\n\n\nFacebook.com/zuora\n\n@Zuora\n\n#SubscriptionEconomy\n\nAbout Zuora Inc.\n\nZuora's solution allows any business in any industry to launch or shift products to subscription, implement new pay-as-you-go pricing and packaging models, gain new insights into subscriber behavior, open new revenue streams, and disrupt market segments to gain competitive advantage.

The association remains committed, therefore, to bring forward non-partisan leading reports that include multiple perspectives to help lay the road map for achieving the 1 trillion dollars digital economy along with job creation, improving livelihood and contribution to the overall GDP of the country.”\n\nOther new appointees in the IAMAI council include Dhruv Shringi, cofounder and CEO, Yatra as the new vice chairman of IAMAI.

Today, India has the second highest internet population of over 460 Mn internet users.\n\nIAMAI had predicted that India’s internet users are expected to register double-digit growth to reach 627 Mn in 2019, driven by rapid internet growth in rural areas.\n\nAnother synergy between Amazon and Indian internet comes as a recent Trust Research Advisory (TRA) report revealed that among trusted brands in India, ecommerce giant Amazon is the leader.\n\nFurther, the use of internet is also at the cusp of larger growth as government as well as private players such as Google explore offerings of free public WiFi. The growth has also come in because of Reliance Jio and its free voice and data offers.\n\n2019 Mary Meeker report also noted Reliance Jio as one of the most innovative internet companies based outside the US. The report has focussed on the company’s efforts in expanding offline or hybrid access to ecommerce.", "entities": []}
{"text": "UAE Hosts First Startup India Summit; 16 Indian Startups Take The Stage.\n\nIndia is the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. It is climbing up to become number two by leading in tech innovation, to reach the next 6 Bn users. The ecosystem is looking to spread its wings far and wide and one such place it’s looking at is the Middle East. Earlier this week, the embassy of India in Abu Dhabi, UAE in partnership with non-profit think tank iSPIRT, and TiE Dubai organised the Startup India Summit 2017 in Dubai.\n\nThis was the first “Startup Summit” being held in the UAE by the Consul General of India (CGI) in Dubai and Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi. It brought together the two ecosystems as well as presented carefully curated high-tech startups.\n\nThe summit aimed to provide a platform for the startup ecosystem in both India and UAE for greater collaboration, exchanging ideas, interact with academia, investors and industry, access to funding, and get the requisite hand-holding and mentoring to grow and prosper.\n\nThe Startup India Summit\n\nIn all, 16 Indian startups in the artificial intelligence, SaaS, fintech, healthtech, deeptech or innovative technology space took part in the two-day event. The deeptech startups included AllgoVision, Locus, Oizom, Posist, and Team Indus while the SaaS bandwagon consisted of Capillary Technologies, CloudCherry, and Fyle. Meanwhile, Capital Float, Faircent, Remitr, and ToneTag were the fintech startups which made it to the summit while the healthtech sector was represented by Aindra, NIRAMAI, Sigtuple, and Tricog.\n\nIndian Ambassador to the UAE Navdeep Singh Suri opened the two-day event with this remark, “Startup India is a flagship programme of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and it is our endeavour to promote it in the UAE. India is the third-largest ecosystem in the world leading in tech innovation globally while the UAE aims to be the global hub for technology in the future.”\n\nOther speakers at the opening session included Ronaldo Mouchawer, founder, Souq.com; Sanjay Anandram of iSPIRT; Rajeev Kakar, MD and CEO, Duniya; Khalfan Belhoul, Dubai Future Accelerators, among others.\n\nSpeaking to Inc42, Mohandas Pai stated that the aim of the summit was to showcase Indian startups to the UAE and further build the India brand as a Product Nation. He added that while the response was encouraging and invigorating, more needs to be done. When asked about challenges Indian startups face to expand geographically, he said, “Management bandwidth, capability and funds are challenges.” He further added, “Medtech, fintech using AI/ML (machine learning) are some of the sectors Indian startups have a big opportunity to expand in, outside India.”\n\nExperts at the event called for greater collaboration between the UAE and India to develop startup ecosystems. They said more such events in the future would provide increasing interactions to foster greater cooperation between young entrepreneurs.\n\nImage Credits\n\nIBPC Dubai President Bindu Chettur stated that the council would act as a platform for Indian firms looking to explore and engage with strong investment partners and clients both from the public and private sectors. She added, “Through such investment platforms, the IBPC seeks to be partners of the first choice for Indian startups in exploring access to both seed capital and growth capital.”\n\nSimilarly, Vipul, Consul-General of India to the UAE, added that India’s startup ecosystem could be the main springboard to propel the country to a new growth trajectory, helping it to achieve the goal of emerging as a $10 Tn economy by 2030.\n\nThe first session titled “The India Ecosystem Story” was moderated by Sanjay Anandram, with a panel consisting of Mohan Kumar, Partner – Norwest Venture Partners; Shanti Mohan, co-founder LetsVenture; and Sanjay Swamy, Managing Partner at Prime Venture Partners. The next session focussed on “Venture Investment in the Middle East, Expectations and Status Check” and was moderated by Prashant K Gulati, Founder & Managing Partner, The SmartStart Fund. Experts at this session observed that a lot of startups fail to grow because of lack of mentorship, investment, pitching platforms and policy awareness. Presentations from startups, which were moderated by Prathibha Sastry of Innofest, followed in the later part of the event.\n\nThe second leg of the event took place in Abu Dhabi on May 24, 2017.\n\nThe Experience\n\nSpeaking to Inc42, some of the startups shared their experience and takeaways from the summit.\n\nSandeep Jhingran, co-founder fintech startup Remitr stated, “The event was well-planned and Remitr presented our product to folks in the technology sector, financial services, and Government. As a fintech startup, our vision is to make cross-border payments as easy as making a local payment in one’s own country. We have been very impressed by the emerging opportunities in UAE such as the Abu Dhabi Global Market programme that promotes innovation in financial services.”\n\nHe further added that the startup also met potential partners with whom it is now exploring to expand its remittance product to business payments and to immigrants from under-served geographies.\n\nSimilar sentiments were expressed by Prem K Viswanath, co-founder of SaaS startup CloudCherry who stated that the Startup India Summit in Dubai & Abu Dhabi validated that the UAE is a market that’s rapidly evolving, and is looking for innovations and new technologies to cater to tomorrow’s needs and expectations. He said, “We were delighted to be part of a delegation that not just got the opportunity to showcase our wares to some of the top business houses, investors and leaders of the UAE, but also be a representative to demonstrate India’s continued superiority & growth in technology.”\n\nThe summit exposed Indian startups to the tremendous opportunity in the UAE was also reiterated by Aneesh Reddy, co-founder of omnichannel engagement and commerce solution Capillary Technologies. Aneesh said, “It was an enriching experience and the coming together of great minds from both India and the UAE. There is tremendous interest in, and opportunity for, Indian startups in the UAE. Besides business opportunities for Indian startups, the leaders in UAE are very keen to foster entrepreneurship and there is a lot of learning from India that can be transferred.”\n\nLike other startups, Capillary also is excited with the opportunity in UAE and the rest of the Middle East and is looking at very rapid growth from the region.\n\nAshish Tulsian, co-founder Posist Technlogies, also agreed. He said, “It was a fantastic opportunity by iSprit as well as the Indian consulate in Dubai and embassy in Abu Dhabi. Not many times you get an opportunity to showcase your product to such accomplished and important audience while being endorsed by your country’s government as the best in class. For us it was an enriching experience as we are exploring Middle East as a market and we found a lot of potential partners, customers and advisors who I am sure we could not have spotted from any easy route.”\n\nThe same was felt by Geetha Manjunath, co-founder of healthtech startup NIRAMAI which is developing an innovative breast cancer screening solution for detecting early-stage cancer. Geetha said, “We got a good response from the audience at the summit. We got in touch with many people who were interested in becoming local contact points for our products to enter UAE. We also got connected with hospitals and diagnostic centres who were interested in piloting our solutions.”\n\nGeetha added that since NIRAMAI uses a screening method which is very private and does not even involve touching the patient, hence adoption in countries with a higher population such as UAE looks more promising. Additionally, the startup also connected with the Indian investor community there, who wanted to contribute back to India by investing in Indian startups.\n\nRajesh Viswanathan, CFO of online lending platform Capital Float added, “The UAE has a mature understanding and appreciation of fintech. They are formulating regulatory policies to promote fintech in the region. The Startup India Summit further exemplifies this push, as it helps facilitate inter-cultural learning from a fintech perspective.”\n\nNishith Rastogi, co-founder and CEO of logistics management startup, Locus summed it up well, “The summit proved to be an excellent platform to infuse a spirit of innovation in all who attended! The summit also provided us with a view of the healthy market, and great infrastructure that UAE presents – this gives the startup space amazing confidence in the value that the Middle East holds, both as a partner and as a market.”\n\nHere’s hoping this confidence translates into more market space for Indian startups in the region.\n\nThe Startup India Summit was sponsored by Abu Dhabi Global Market (the international financial centre in Abu Dhabi, UAE), Indian Business & Professional Group, and the Indian Business and Professional Council (IBPC).", "entities": []}

{"text": "NASSCOM Recommends Incentivising R&D And Talent Development Investments Ahead Of Union Budget.\n\nInvestors who invest in eligible startups with an intention of value accretion should be benefited with tax deductions\n\nIt laid out several growth focused recommendations to the Government of India\n\nThe National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), today announced its recommendations for the upcoming Union Budget to be tabled by the newly appointed Government in the forthcoming parliamentary session. These recommendations cover several areas that may help the Indian startup ecosystem as well.\n\nWith the industry accounting for over 6.6% of the nation’s GDP and employing over 4.1 Mn skilled individuals, it clear that it has a multiplier effect on India’s economy and promoting it is crucial to achieve the $5 Tn GDP milestone by 2024.\n\nThe recommendations went on to state that India’s strength in IT-BPM services must be consolidated to establish a tax-friendly Special Economic Zone policy for the next 20 years which would help retain existing tax benefits as well as continue to generate employment while increasing foreign exchange earnings.\n\nIncentivising R&D Based Investments\n\nIndia’s Engineering, R&D market has grown to $30 Bn in the financial year 2019 and is estimated to touch $42 Bn by 2022. While there has been a continued focus on encouraging IT adoption and allocation of funds across sectors like an Innovation fund for secondary education, currently there are no specific incentives for R&D for IT companies.\n\nFor this NASSCOM has said that measures to promote the creation of intellectual property in ER&D through incentivising investments in centres of global MNCs in India and nurturing 1000 technology spin-offs from the ER&D centres in India primarily through 3D printing can help generate direct and in-direct employment for 350,000 people by 2025.\n\nIncentivising Talent Development And Skilling\n\nBuilding on NASSCOM’s initiative to inculcate a well-equipped and future-ready workforce in the industry, they have recommended setting a budget of Rs. 500 crore for the financial year for co-funding talent development and re-skilling in IT services.\n\nWith a requirement to reskill 40% of the country’s 4 million strong IT workforce to cope with emerging technologies, it is recommended to incentivise firms by promoting expenditure on developing skills and training programs undertaken by the industry.\n\nGrow India As a Technology Startup Hub\n\nIt has been recommended that investments be encouraged through Long Term Capital Gains from the sale of shares unlisted companies being made exempt from tax while Short Term Capital Gains being taxed at 15% instead of the current income tax slab of the individual.\n\nInvestors who invest in eligible start-ups with an intention of value accretion should be benefited with tax deductions, on the lines of Singapore and UK. Start-ups and SME’s with a turnover of less than INR 50 crores should also be exempted from MAT.\n\nEase taxation regime And Promote Ease Of Doing Business\n\nThere must be adequate clarity provided with respect to the Significant Economic Presence provisions. These should also be aligned with the proposed consensus of the G20 and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Tax credit of Equalisation Levy must also be extended and made available to foreign companies operating in the home country.\n\nBy reducing 18.5% rate of MAT for companies, especially those with a turnover of up to Rs 250 crore and clarifying that secondment of employees would not constitute a service PE for the foreign entity, would help businesses function more effectively. There must be clarity on tax treatment of compensation received on termination or modification of the terms of the contract.\n\nInvest In E-waste Management\n\nNASSCOM has recommended the introduction of a point-based reward system of e-waste recycling credits for formal organisations to incentivise them to channel their e-waste through government-approved recycling centres.\n\nCo-funding incentives should also be provided to metropolitan city governments to set up new recycling units through public-private partnerships with large e-waste companies.\n\nNITI Aayog, MeitY and the Central Pollution Control Board may also be involved for this stage for industrial consultations to devise a roadmap for a long-term solution for e-waste management.\n\nNASSCOM has submitted an extensive recommendations document to the Government for their consideration.", "entities": []}

{"text": "After ShopClues’ Plea, Delhi HC Sets Aside Its 2018 Order.\n\nOn April 4, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court had set aside its November 2018 order in the case of ecommerce platform ShopClues vs US-based headphone maker SkullCandy and French personal care company L’Oreal. The HC further directed Justice Pratibha Singh to reinvestigate and present the case again in a hearing on May 6, 2019.\n\nThe Delhi High Court’s earlier order had denied ShopClues protection under Section 79 of the IT Act, which offers safe harbour to intermediaries (or marketplaces, in this case). Also, the court had restrained the ecommerce platform and other online sellers from selling counterfeit products.\n\nThe Division Bench comprising of Justice Muralidhar and Justice I.S. Mehta has now noted that its earlier order was passed without following the complete court procedure. The bench also noted that the judgement was made without giving a fair opportunity to ShopClues to present its case.\n\nIn response to this order, ShopClues said, “ShopClues welcomes the Delhi High Court’s order and believes that it will benefit all ecommerce players who operate a marketplace platform.”\n\nShopClues Vs L’Oreal And SkullCandy\n\nIn November 2018, a judgment was passed by Justice Pratibha Singh in lawsuits filed by L’Oreal and SkullCandy against ShopClues. The lawsuit has alleged ShopClues of selling counterfeit products on its platform. ShopClues filed two appeals to the Delhi High Court. The matter was first heard on January 14, 2019 in respect of L’Oreal appeal and on February 1, 2019 in relation to the Skullcandy appeal.\n\nAmong other arguments, ShopClues had said in its appeal that it was not given an opportunity to present its case and thus, the judgment which was passed without following the due procedure of law was erroneous and needed to be set aside.\n\nGurugram-based ecommerce platform ShopClues was founded in 2011 by Sanjay Sethi and Radhika Ghai. The company claims to have 100 Mn monthly visitors and 28 Mn listing on its platform. ShopClues has over 600K merchants on its platform spread across 31.5K pin codes across India. The company became a Unicorn in 2016 with a Series E funding round led by Sovereign Wealth Fund GIC Pte Ltd. Other investors such as Tiger Global Management LLC, Helion Venture Partners & Nexus Venture Partners also participated in the round.\n\nOther Similar Cases\n\nThere have been similar lawsuits against ecommerce companies in the past. In 2015, a saree distributor Shree Meena Creations had also filed a lawsuit against ecommerce majors including Flipkart, Amazon and eBay, along with about two dozen of their online sellers for allegedly selling replicas of their apparel.\n\nAnother saree brand Nalli Sarees had also served a cease and desist order to Snapdeal for allegedly using Nalli’s registered trademark and claiming to have original Nalli sarees on their portal.\n\nFurther in 2017, a German luxury products maker Montblanc had sued ecommerce platform digaaz.com for selling counterfeit pens manufactured by the company at lower rates.\n\nAfter this Delhi High Court judgment of banning ecommerce website ShopClues from selling counterfeit products, the All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) had also asked the consumers affairs ministry and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) to widen the ruling to all ecommerce retailers operating in the country.\n\nIntermediary Liability\n\nThis is not the first case which has questioned the intermediary liability in India. This week, Chinese video-sharing app TikTok was banned by the Madras High Court.

Loxbridge will provide a milestone-based seed-funding funding package worth US$7 million.\n\n\n\nAltermune is pioneering the use of 'programmable immunity'. This involves re-tasking antibodies that are ubiquitous in all humans, present at a high background level, and which are ordinarily not tasked by the body in fighting infections.\n\n\n\nAltermune uses 'linker' molecules to redirect these antibodies to selected pathogens. The linker molecules work through having two distinct ends. One end binds a consistent cell-surface target on the pathogen using an aptamer (a single stranded oligonucleotide), and the other end presents specific epitopes that attract the circulating antibodies.\n\n\n\nOnce attached to the pathogen, via the Altermune linker, the antibodies then activate a full immune response, heightened because they are the individual's own endogenous antibodies, not synthetic administered ones. The approach therefore harnesses the power of the immune system, yet circumvents the disadvantages of administering monoclonal antibodies - such as immunogenicity and high costs.\n\n\n\nAltermune has a strong team of in-house scientists, and a wide network of partnerships, including collaborative research arrangements with a number of leading Universities in the USA and Europe and corporate relationships with leading companies in oligonucleotide synthesis and aptamer selection.\n\n\n\nDr Roberts, CEO, commented:\n\n\n\n\"We are very excited about entering a joint venture with an innovator with such an awe-inspiring track record. The initial priority is to build on the compelling proof of concept of the Altermune platform, demonstrated in vivo against influenza - and against anthrax by US Air Force scientists - into a broad pipeline of compounds against clinically and commercially relevant pathogens, to undergo FDA approval.\n\n\n\nDr Mullis added:\n\n\n\n\"We chose to proceed with Loxbridge over other suitors because, unlike our other potential funders, the investment is smart money that comes with project management and hands-on commercial expertise. It seems to work very well that the investor is also the entrepreneur, able to pilot the project. This structure frees me from ongoing business administration, and enables me to focus on the science.â€", "entities": [[0, 22, "org_in_focus"], [28, 31, "money_funded"], [32, 36, "type_of_funding"], [98, 116, "investor"], [153, 157, "type_of_funding"], [188, 198, "money_funded"], [979, 988, "investor"], [1020, 1024, "type_of_funding"], [1055, 1067, "money_funded"]]}

{"text": "Punit Soni On What It Takes To Traverse Both The Indian And Silicon Valley Startup Ecosystem.\n\nAt the time when the Indian Startup Ecosystem has been bolstering itself with activities in various segments after recording over $13.5 Bn across 885 deals in 2017, the trend continued with Q1, 2018 reaching with the ecosystem registering over 196 deals for $1.17 Bn.\n\nHowever, the edge in the global startup ecosystem remains with the Silicon Valley continuously. As global companies identify the Indian potential with a commitment of billions of dollars, we tried to address the basic question of difference in the Indian and Silicon Valley Startup Ecosystem.\n\nDuring a recent Inc42 Facebook Live AMA, we caught up with Punit Soni, ex-Chief Product Officer of Flipkart and the current CEO of healthtech startup Robin, who has traversed with equal ease both the Indian and the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem.\n\n“I think the Indian startup ecosystem is the most exciting startup ecosystem in the world right now because of its people. It’s because of you guys. I think it has the largest concentration of young people in the world trying to build companies on their own.”\n\nHe elaborated that even though there’s going to be quite a few years and a lot of failed startups, he believes that one of the greatest companies in the world – in the league of Google is going to come out of India. He also expects that this will happen in the next few years, adding that fundamentally the potential of India is way bigger than almost any place in the world.\n\nHowever, Soni also emphasised that “What the Valley has is a degree of sophistication around it that is unparalleled. So what the valley does is that it gives you within a radius of 40 square miles the smartest people from every category in the world. And loads of them, not just one or two. That’s something that will take some time to replicate anywhere, let alone India. So, that’s probably the most fundamental difference between India and the Valley.”\n\nHe cited his own example of starting Robin. He shared that when he wanted to start a company, he spent six months honing the thesis after which he met the best investors and in a matter of two hikes, they decided how will Robin begin. “And then everything starts falling in place. The lawyers know exactly what they need to do, the go-to-market folks know exactly what they have to do and my engineers are from Google and Salesforce.”\n\nHe further added that you are able to get the absolute best network of people to start attacking the problem. He cited that he has doctors who are MDs from the best medical universities in the world working in the team. He added that it’s very hard anywhere in the world to put together a team from Google, the best medical universities in the world, even Apple, and the best venture capitalists together to do this.\n\nEarlier in an interview, Soni had said, “The problems I want to solve are easier to find in the US.” So, we bugged him further about this to find out that he meant that it will be easier for him to solve them in the US because most of his network is there and most of the talent that he wants to attract is there.\n\n“There are interesting problems to solve in India too, but making a startup work is hard. And when you are part of a startup, it’s hard enough that you have to find a problem, then you have to attract a team. After that you have to raise money, and then you have to put it all together. You want to do it from a position of strength,” he added.\n\nAfter a stint in Flipkart, Soni has been exploring healthtech space with his startup Robin, which is building AI solutions for healthcare. Robin intends to reinvent healthcare using cutting-edge machine learning and conversational voice. It is a digital assistant that helps doctors take care of their patients better by offloading most of their administrative work and over time, assisting them on the clinical end.\n\nAlso, with Soni’s strong product focus he has attracted Marc Benioff (CEO of Salesforce); Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and chief of Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Social Capital along with some of the leading investors in the US to back it in its testing phase.\n\nWith global healthcare IT market anticipated to reach $104.5 Bn by 2020, Robin has a long way to go with Punit Soni leading the charge towards its success.", "entities": []}

{"text": "SA crowdfunding site The People’s Fund in first payout of R43k to 42 investors.\n\nTen months after launching, Johannesburg based crowdfunding platform The People’s Fund has made its first payout of R43 800 to 42 investors who earlier this year invested a total of R219 000 in a Bloemfontein based internet company, MySurfer.\n\nThe People’s Fund is an initiative of three companies — entrepreneurship networking organisation the Hookup Dinner, BrownSense which runs a monthly market in Midrand for black businesses and digital marketing company Payback.\n\nSpeaking to Ventureburn yesterday, platform’s co-founder Luyanda Jafta said it is the first of eight expected payments to MySurfer investors who invested in the campaign which ran from November last year to February.\n\nMySurfer provides affordable internet to students and approached the platform after securing a contract from a student accommodation company in the same city. The internet company needed capital to buy and install the wireless access points in 175 buildings.\n\nJafta said his crowdfunding platform, which allows ordinary people to buy assets that entrepreneurs need in their business and retain ownership of these until they have been repaid, has since launching 10 months ago raised over R1.5-million for 11 black businesses through 12 campaigns.\n\nSome of their campaigns include buying 360 hives for bee-keeping company Native Nosi, buying a vehicle refrigeration system for Pretoria based chopped vegetable delivery service ChefCuts — to launching a crowd-owned cinema chain, iStarring Cinemas.\n\nThe People’s Fund crowdfunding platform has raised over R1.5-million in 10 months for black businesses through 12 campaigns\n\nAbout 1000 investors have taken part in the campaigns so far. The largest individual contribution from any one investor has been R50 000.\n\nJafta said most of the investors on the platform are aged between 25 and 35 years old. Initially about 60% were white, but he said the percentage of black investors has grown thanks to a stokvel run by BrownSense. Contributions from BrownSense now account for about 20% of all contributions.\n\nOver 20% in returns for investors\n\nAnnualised, the return on the contribution the crowd puts in, is at 30% (around 22% once the fees the platform takes are discounted). “This represents at least two times what the best fixed deposit in the country offers,” said Jafta.\n\nHe said the platform typically levies a fee of 20% to 30% on the value of the initial asset, which is then paid back to investors in the form of a royalty, over the lifetime of the asset.\n\nThe platform’s owners generate a revenue by leverages a fee of 10% on each investor’s contribution for a campaign.\n\nBut not cheap for businesses\n\nBut these returns mean businesses will have to pay quite a hefty fee — perhaps double what they would have had to pay had they gone via a local bank, but about the same as another local online lending platform, RainFin — to get funding through the platform.\n\nThe platform’s focus is on black-owned businesses and Jafta said the platform will only bankroll businesses that are looking for asset finance and that are able to generate a year-on-year revenue of 20% to 30%.\n\nIt’s largely because of these two criteria that the platform has opted to run campaigns for just 12 of the about 150 applications it had received.\n\nJafta said a large number of applications so far have come from startups with no proven revenue that are looking for working capital to pay salaries rather than to finance the purchase of assets.\n\n‘Even FSB struggled to place us’\n\nCrowdfunding is not regulated in South Africa, but Jafta said the platform is not out of step with any local legislation.\n\nThe platform does not provide loans or take equity in the companies it helps investors fund, but rather allows investors to purchase and retain ownership of an asset until they have been repaid by the participating business or organisation.\n\nRead more: SA equity crowdfunding site Uprise.Africa launches after response from FSB\n\nRead more: FSB misses its own crowdfunding deadline\n\nLike this, there is no need for the platform to fall under any license, he said, adding that “even the FSB (Financial Services Board) struggled to place us”.\n\nAll investors need do, he said is to ensure that they get a certificate of ownership of the asset they are helping finance.\n\nYet to fund tenderers\n\nJafta said the platform’s primary goal for the year is to become a Section 12J company; which would allow any contribution made by the crowd to be tax deductible, he added.\n\n“We also want to focus on industrial projects such as construction and agriculture. These offer great partnerships with government and the like to truly extract value and allow for broad ownership of the economy,” he said.\n\nThe platform’s current projects include JustLaundry, a laundry delivery service looking to buy some more machinery to service a greater audience. The laundry service has offered the crowd R5 per kilo of laundry completed in the next six years.\n\nJafta said the platform has not funded assets for any black contractors who win government tenders, but has sought to deal instead with black startups with fast moving consumer goods.\n\nHowever, he added that the platform is in talks to partner with a government department to help mentor black businesses.\n\nFor now the platform, he said, is still trying to work out how it will finance businesses that service the government.\n\nFeatured image: The People’s Fund co-founder Luyanda Jafta (Supplied)", "entities": []}

In second and third places were Zambia and Mozambique, receiving approximately 10 per cent and eight per cent of funds respectively.\n\nInternational development finance institutions (DFIs) were responsible for deploying 75 per cent of impact capital in the region, to the value of US$16.8 billion through over 650 deals, the research finds.\n\nOf this figure, US$13 billion was disbursed after 2005, as such the researchers conclude activity in the impact investing market has accelerated over the past decade particularly.\n\nAccording to the data, South Africa-based DFIs were more active than international DFIs – deploying US$17.1 billion regionally through over 7,500 deals. South African DFIs tend towards their own market, however, with US$14.4 billion of capital disbursed by this group going to South African companies through 6,800 deals.\n\nThe GIIN said all investments by South African DFIs took place between 2002 and 2014, with the majority of activity occurring before 2009.\n\nOther types of impact investors are also active in the region, including venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) funds, foundations, commercial banks, and pension funds. Combined these non-DFI sources deployed nearly US$5.7 billion in the region through more than 500 deals.\n\nThe GIIN said the report is aimed at supporting investors already active in Southern Africa, as well as new entrants looking to deploy impact capital.\n\n“Given the growing interest in this important region, we hope that this in-depth market research will serve investors already active in Southern Africa, as well as those looking to deploy impact capital in these diverse countries,” said Amit Bouri, chief executive officer (CEO) of the GIIN.\n\n“Impact investors are continuing to support these sometimes challenging but critical markets, working to demonstrate that investment in the region can drive meaningful social and environmental impact alongside financial returns.”\n\nThe GIIN has previously produced similar reports for impact investing in other regions, most recently, a report covering West Africa, which found the impact investing industry in West Africa is comparatively small, but growing, totalling US$6.8 billion over the past decade.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Despite TikTok Scrutiny, ByteDance To Invest $1 Bn In India.\n\nThe Supreme Court and Madras HC to hear the TikTok case on April 22 and April 24 respectively\n\nByteDance has invested $100 Mn in India for Helo, Vigo and TikTok apps in the last year\n\nIt’s been only three days since ByteDance’s TikTok app was removed from Google Play Store and Apple App Store in India, but ByteDance remains bullish on the Indian market. The Chinese social networking company is now planning to invest $1 Bn in its India operations..\n\nSpeaking to an Indian media publication, the company said that it has already invested $100 Mn in the last year, and now is planning to invest $1 Bn. However, the company didn’t reveal any timeline pertaining to its India investments.\n\nThe company is also planning to float a new video-sharing app after India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) directed Google and Apple to delist TikTok from the Play Store on Android and App Store on iOS respectively.\n\nTikTok India Fiasco\n\nTikTok which claims to have 120 Mn monthly active users in India faced severe criticism for evading norms under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and allegedly spreading child pornography.\n\nIn this regard, on February 24, 2019, advocate S. Muthukumar filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in Madras High Court against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Ministry of Communications, District Collector (Madurai District), Commissioner of Police (Madurai) and the business head of TikTok.\n\nMuthukumar accused TikTok of spreading pornography, violence and blasphemy. A number of deaths occurred due to TikTok with some of the casualties, victims aged between 10 to 30, said the PIL.\n\nRelated Article: ByteDance To Setup Local Data Centres In India Over The Next Two Years\n\nHearing the PIL, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court comprising of Justices N Kirubakaran and SS Sundar passed an interim order (on April 3) which read:\n\nThe government of India directed to prohibit downloading of TikTok mobile app Media is prohibited from telecasting the videos made using TikTok mobile app.; and The government has to answer whether the Union of India will enact a statute, like Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, enacted by the United States, to prevent the children from becoming cyber/online victims.\n\nOn April 13, ByteDance released a statement and said that it has removed over six million videos that have violated its community guidelines. The press release also said that TikTok has now introduced its age-gate feature to restrict sign-ups to users aged13 years and above. TikTok further said it would be adding to the safety mechanisms to ensure that underage users do not use the platform.\n\nIn the next hearing on April 16, the Madras High Court appointed Arvind Datar as amicus curiae (independent counsel) in the case to examine the implications of the app. The next hearing in the case is on April 24.\n\nMeanwhile, Google and Apple delisted TikTok from their app stores, after receiving directions from the Indian government.\n\nAs a result, TikTok moved to Supreme Court against the Madras High Court’s order on the ground that a ban on the download and use of the app not only curtails its right to freedom of speech and expression but that it would also lead to financial losses and loss of jobs.\n\nThe two-judge bench of Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Sanjiv Khanna, however, declined a stay on the ban and listed the matter for further hearing on April 22.\n\nTikTok which offers social media content in 10 Indian regional languages, has not only faced criticism for the lack of age filters in its app but also for the lack of privacy policy and user agreements being available in all the languages it supports. As a result, TikTok users are not even aware of terms they agree to while signing up for the app, if they cannot read English.\n\nMeanwhile, India Internet Foundation has come in support of TikTok, terming the ban disproportionate. On April 17, the Foundation in a letter addressed to MeitY said that there is an urgent need to commence a policy dialogue and indicate a way forward to ensure the benefits of digital tools and technologies can be harnessed by large sections of Indians while mitigating harms.\n\n“Two recent instances include a ban on a popular video game called PUBG in various districts of Gujarat that resulted in the arrest of at least 21 young persons. Similarly, the ban on a popular video sharing platform called Tik Tok has resulted in preventing its download from Application Stores. These are in contravention of the fundamental rights, particularly the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a). Any restriction on such rights needs to be, “reasonable”, pursuant to a valid legal authority and as per the grounds of restriction as prescribed under Article 19(2),” reads the letter.\n\nIs TikTok Really Banned?\n\nWhile it is true that the Google Play Store and Apple AppStore have taken down the official TikTok app, this has not affected the existing users. Those who downloaded the app earlier can seamlessly continue to access the app without interruption.\n\nOn Android, TikTok’s APK or installation file can be shared through Shareit, over Bluetooth and by other means, plus there are numerous third-party services that let you download Android app stores outside the official Play Store. Services such as by Apkpure, APK Mirror Android APK Box and uptodown continue to distribute the app.\n\nIndia is not the only to have banned TikTok; earlier, Bangladesh and Indonesia also cracked down on the app for allegedly spreading blasphemy and pornography.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Arkuda Therapeutics Closes $44M Series A Financing to Advance Novel Medicines Targeting Progranulin and Lysosomal Biology to Treat Neurodegenerative Diseases.\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Arkuda Therapeutics, a company leveraging new insights into progranulin and lysosomal biology to develop medicines to change the trajectory of neurodegenerative disease, today announced the completion of a $44 million Series A financing. Led by a team of drug developers and scientists with deep experience in central nervous system disorders and neurodegeneration, Arkuda's lead therapeutic approach centers on improving lysosomal function and neuronal health by increasing levels of progranulin, and its functional subunits, granulins, in the central nervous system. Atlas Venture co-founded, seeded and incubated the company, and co-led the Series A financing with Pfizer Ventures, with participation from funds managed by Tekla Capital Management LLC, and BioInnovation Capital.\n\nArkuda's initial therapeutic focus is a devastating genetically-defined disease called GRN-related frontotemporal dementia (FTD-GRN), which strikes people between the ages of 45 and 65. Individuals with FTD-GRN have an autosomal dominant mutation in one of the alleles of the GRN gene, which codes for progranulin, a protein known to play an important role in lysosomal function and innate immunity in the brain. FTD-GRN is marked by progressive and rapid nerve cell loss in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, impacting personality, behavior, language, memory and movement, with a typical life expectancy of 6 to 7 years following the appearance of symptoms.\n\n\"We believe that the challenges in treating neurodegeneration stem from targeting disease pathologies rather than root causes such as lysosomal dysfunction, as well as from treating patients too late in their disease when significant damage has already occurred,\" said Gerhard Koenig, PhD, co-founder, president and CEO, Arkuda Therapeutics. \"FTD-GRN presents a unique and exciting opportunity to address a key driver of neurodegeneration before it progresses too far.\"\n\nIt is now understood that the deficiency in progranulin and subsequently, granulins in GRN mutation carriers causes lysosomal dysfunction which leads to neurodegeneration. Arkuda is harnessing new and evolving insights into the role of progranulins and granulins in lysosomal health to drive the discovery of small molecules to restore and maintain neuronal health. Using existing biomarkers to reliably identify GRN mutation carriers and those at risk of symptomatic conversion, the company's goal is to intervene as early as possible in the disease.\n\n\"For years, companies have focused their efforts on targeting neurodegenerative disease pathologies such as amyloid beta and tau, with little success,\" said Bruce Booth, DPhil, Arkuda board chairman and partner at Atlas Venture. \"There is growing scientific evidence showing the critical importance of lysosomes in maintaining neuronal health in FTD as well as in other diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Arkuda's unique approach in targeting progranulin, a critical driver of lysosomal function, has the potential to have a truly meaningful impact for patients and their families.\"\n\nArkuda Therapeutics was founded in 2018 by Atlas Venture, Gerhard Koenig and Duane Burnett, PhD, Senior Vice President, Discovery.\n\nAbout Arkuda Therapeutics\n\nArkuda Therapeutics is a biotechnology company leveraging new insights into progranulin and lysosomal biology to develop medicines to change the trajectory of neurodegenerative disease. Arkuda's lead compounds aim to correct progranulin deficiency and lysosomal dysfunction in GRN-related frontotemporal dementia (FTD-GRN), a genetically-defined subtype of frontotemporal dementia caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the GRN gene.

Office space firms such as WeWork and Industrious as well as living space providers like Common and The Collective are leveraging the sharing economy to provide solutions. STRT's innovative design takes this idea to the next level by bringing even more into the experience of a single property.\n\n\"Imagine if you could take the elements of Silicon Valley that make entrepreneurs successful – creativity, passion, talent, capital – and then make it accessible without having to move to the Bay Area,\" said founder Troy D'Ambrosio. \"STRT has developed a building design, programming and resources that provide access to this environment for entrepreneurs located anywhere.\"\n\n\"Talent is distributed everywhere yet the overwhelming amount of venture capital is concentrated in a few areas dominated by Silicon Valley. This bubble creates a barrier for both entrepreneurs and investors alike,\" said Victor Gill, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. \"STRT is about providing entrepreneurs access to other talented people and connecting them with the capital and the resources they need to grow.\"\n\nSTRT Nodes merge coliving, coworking, accelerator services and capital under one roof eliminating the need for the founding team to find these resources on their own. Each STRT Node will bring talented people together in one location – a mini-city creating the future.\n\n\"The STRT concept creates a town of entrepreneurs. A place where people live, eat, work and create together. The result is more than the sum of the parts. Our goal is to take the STRT concept to 50 or more cities and bring access to entrepreneurs everywhere,\" said Troy D'Ambrosio.\n\nAmenities at STRT properties will focus on the needs of creatives and entrepreneurs and will be all-inclusive providing data services, cleaning, working space, meeting rooms and a cafe.\n\nAccess to capital will be a key amenity. STRT will invest in promising startups developed in STRT Nodes and bring in its network of affiliate investors to co-invest in those select companies. STRT is focused on long term development. \"We will have the opportunity to watch startup teams develop and grow over months. At the right time we will begin working with them if they need to raise capital and co-invest with our affiliate investors,\" said Victor Gill.\n\nSTRT is finalizing plans to bring these unique properties to several markets. Qualified Opportunity Zones are a key area of interest for STRT Nodes. Opportunity Zones offer resources, developer interest and a mechanism to catalyze an area while attracting the ideal talent to a STRT Node.\n\nLearn more at STRT.com\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nVictor Gill\n\nCo-founder & CEO\n\nPhone: 801.694.1462\n\nEmail: info@strt.com\n\nRelated Images\n\nstrt-logo.png\n\nstrt-amenities.png\n\nstrt-everything-in-one-place.png\n\nRelated Links\n\nSTRT Home\n\nSOURCE STRT, Inc.", "entities": [[0, 4, "org_in_focus"], [26, 30, "type_of_funding"], [118, 132, "headquarters_loc"], [134, 146, "date_of_funding"], [163, 173, "org_in_focus"], [288, 292, "type_of_funding"], [319, 342, "investor"], [344, 366, "investor"], [371, 390, "investor"], [411, 415, "year_founded"], [417, 421, "org_in_focus"]]}

Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that the EV’s have much less in the form of moving parts, they are lighter and there’s no noise. These days, Electric vehicles are faster and smarter than their traditional internal combustion cousins.\n\nSono Sion powered by solar panels!\n\nTo date, there are few all-electric sports car that combines high-tech science and high-end performance with an impressive design. Munich-based Sono Sion is one among them!\n\nEarlier this year, Sono Motors unveiled Sion, an electric car partially powered by solar panels on the vehicle. Interestingly, this car comes equipped with both battery pack and 248 integrated solar cells that can charge the vehicle.\n\nInterior unveiled!\n\nFounded by Laurin Hahn in 2016, the Munich-based Sono Motors aims to end the usage of fossil fuels in exchange for sustainable mobility. While the mass production is expected to go somewhere around the second half of 2019, Sono Motors has presented first images of the Sion interior as part of an online campaign.\n\nHere’s why you should be excited about the launch of this solar-powered self-charging electric car.\n\nWell-equipped infotainment system!\n\nThe first insight into the Sion cockpit shows, Sono puts “functionality, intuitive operability, user-friendliness and connectivity” at the center of its design.\n\nAs per the company claims, all the mobility services can be controlled directly through the central 10-inch display of the infotainment system with integrated connectivity as well as via the goSono app.\n\nBut, the data concerning the vehicle’s solar range is made available on the 7-inch display within the steering wheel area. Furthermore, a smartphone can be connected to the infotainment system via Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nbreSono!\n\nThe most striking aspect of the cockpit design is the breSono, a natural filter that improves the indoor climate.\n\nThe German carmaker added:\n\nThe moss has been specially treated so that it’s no longer a living thing. Despite this, it still maintains its positive features for filtering out particulate matter and regulating humidity.\n\nMoreover, the interior greenery visuals are enhanced by lighting systems that can be individually adjusted.\n\nRoberto Diesel, CTO of Sono Motors, said:\n\nIn conjunction with sharing services and autonomous driving, the digitalization of mobility and the increasing interconnectivity of vehicles will play a crucial part in significantly reducing the number of vehicles, especially in urban settings.\n\nBidirectional charging function\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that, Sion is the first production vehicle to bring together solar integration, mobility services, and the option of sharing power via a bidirectional charging function. This inturn makes the car suitable as a sharing vehicle, as well as a private or business vehicle.\n\nThe model features 330 integrated solar cells that are said to produce enough electricity to add around 30 km of range per day in addition to the 250 km it carries in its 30 kWh battery.\n\nTotal of 260,000 vehicles\n\nThe production is scheduled to start in the second half of next year, with a total of 260,000 vehicles as of now. For its rollout, the SEV will be delivered in a version costing €25,500. Other vehicles based on the Sion platform are planned, including for the international market.\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more European technology news.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Ontario Telemedicine Network lays off 15 percent of staff following provincial cuts.\n\nThis week, the Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN) laid off 44 workers following a cut to the agency’s provincial funding. The 15 percent staff reduction comes amid revelations that the province is cutting more than $70 million for eHealth Ontario, a provider of digital health records, as well as nearly $52 million less for health policy and research.\n\n“Some of the cuts might be necessary to divert funding to more efficient pathways of care delivery.”\n\nThe OTN is a non-profit agency that helps Ontario patients access healthcare through virtual care. The cutbacks come despite guarantees from Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s cabinet that no public sector workers would experience layoffs as a result of provincial government funding cuts. Health Minister Christine Elliott has not revealed the exact size of Ontario’s funding cut to OTN.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care told BetaKit it is investing its healthcare dollars to frontline care, and that the eHealth cuts are related to several agencies being moved under one agency – Ontario Health.\n\n“Increasing the use of digital solutions is a key part of a digital‐first health strategy. This includes developing digital tools such as virtual visits, online access to health records and digital supports for integrated care,” a spokesperson from the ministry told BetaKit. “OTN remains committed to supporting that strategy by increasing access to specialized care, reducing pressure on hospitals and improving the patient experience by modernizing the way people can receive care, wherever they live across the province. We look forward to continuing to work with OTN as we work to modernize our public health care system.”\n\nEstablished in 2006, OTN helps deliver virtual health care to Ontario residents. Its service uses video conferencing technology to link doctors and nurses with patients around the province. Rural hospitals and clinics use OTN’s network to access specialists from around the province. OTN’s latest annual report stated it administered almost 900,000 patient consultations, and saved nearly $72 million that would have been paid in health-related travel grants for northern Ontario residents.\n\nRELATED: Procurement could be Canada’s biggest barrier to commercializing healthtech innovation\n\n“When it comes to the modernization of healthcare, some of the cuts might be necessary to divert funding to more efficient pathways of care delivery,” Huda Idrees, founder and CEO of mobile platform Dot Health, told BetaKit. “When the province started funding [OTN], they were the only solution for virtual care in the province. That is no longer true.”\n\nIdrees said companies like Avocare, Dialogue, and Maple (which Dot Health recently partnered with to a launch a joint virtual care solution) can now deliver the same service as the OTN, but at a lower cost, which could justify the cuts.\n\neHealth has created a secure electronic health record information system so medical information can be shared and accessed by healthcare providers. The agency says it processes 27 million requests for patient records per month, and has six billion records in its repositories. It claims 99 percent of hospitals in Ontario are connected to its services.\n\nIdress stated that budget cuts were expected with eHealth being folded into the broader Ontario Health agency.\n\n“Nobody knows… the amounts, of course, until they release them. eHealth has had a tough go of it,” she stated. “They’ve done incredibly important work in putting up provincial data repositories, but a combination of their placement within the Ministry, their mandate as a government service organization, and policies they operate under have prevented them from realizing the full potential of some of the assets they run.”\n\nJocelyn Bourgoin, CEO of Santé Manitouwadge Health, which uses telemedicine services to allow patients to consult with remote specialists, told CBC News that he does not anticipate the job losses will impact patient care.\n\n“The government has made multiple commitments that we need to use technology and advance the access to services through technologies, and OTN is one of the premiere success stories,” he said. “I don’t think that anybody would place the progress we’ve made in jeopardy when the direction is to go further ahead and develop more patient access.”\n\nImage courtesy Wikimedia Commons.", "entities": []}

{"text": "$42m investment in Jobandtalent.\n\nAtomico has just led a $42 million Series B funding round for Jobandtalent – a disruptive startup that solves two major pain-points in the world of recruitment: matching the right talent with the right jobs, and massively reducing the bureaucracy involved in the hiring process. Currently Jobandtalent is available in five cities: Madrid, Barcelona, Mexico City, Bogota and London. Jobtalent was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Madrid.\n\nTalented people from around the world have smartphones and start using them also to look for new job opportunities. The founders of Jobandtalent say that yet when it comes to the recruitment industry most of the work is still conducted offline, using outdated and inefficient business approaches like job postings in retail stores or manual screening of CVs. The team states that it is going to revolutionise the small and medium enterprise (SME) jobs market with matching technology and an innovative transaction-based mobile platform. By using sophisticated algorithms to filter out the right jobs for the right people across millions of users and hundreds of thousands of employers, Jobandtalent is bringing scale, speed and precision to the SME hiring process. Now for the first time, companies will be able to instantly access a pipeline of highly qualified candidates and manage the screening in real time, for free and from the convenience of their mobile. With their innovative transaction-based platform, Jobandtalent will further help SMEs dramatically reduce their overheads as they onboard successful candidates.\n\nNiall Wass, an Executive-in-Residence at Atomico, will be joining the Jobandtalent board. Using his experience of working with three global, multi-billion dollar marketplaces (Betfair, Wonga and most recently Uber where he was SVP of International), he will help Jobandtalent with their overall strategy and growth. The investment will be used to accelerate the company’s international expansion and further develop its product and engineering team.\n\nYann de Vries, Atomico’s lead Investment Partner stated: “The global +$100Bn SME recruitment market, which is very local, offline and fragmented today, will undergo a profound transformation over the next decade and create several multi-billion dollar companies. I am absolutely certain that the offline payroll and staffing agency model will be disrupted by pure digital players. The traditional outsourced staffing model has been a big success for large employers since it helps them focus on their core competency and reduces fixed costs. However, the agency staffing model has so far been inaccessible to SMEs because it’s too expensive and traditional agencies are ill-equipped to serve thousands of small accounts. Jobandtalent is about to change that by providing a better service at a lower cost, just like Uber did for taxi services. After screening 20+ companies across 4 continents and analysing the various trends that matter for this market, we strongly believe that Jobandtalent is best positioned to become the global category leader.”", "entities": [[0, 4, "money_funded"], [19, 31, "org_in_focus"], [34, 41, "investor"], [57, 68, "money_funded"], [69, 77, "type_of_funding"], [96, 108, "org_in_focus"], [416, 425, "org_in_focus"], [441, 445, "year_founded"], [470, 476, "headquarters_loc"]]}

Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nThe primary reason behind it is the very concept of basic builds, meaning a compact body, a small motor attached with the battery pack. Over time, without any doubt, these electric scooters have evolved into a significantly inexpensive, secure and dependable way of transportation for an enormous number of people.\n\nIn a shorter time span, the e-scooter markets have come a long way building a stable foundation.

{"text": "Ebay India Now A Flipkart Group Company; Merger Transaction Complete.\n\nWith Ebay India In Its Arsenal, Flipkart Looks To Expand Sales In The Global Ecommerce Market\n\nThe merger transaction between home-bred ecommerce giant Flipkart and eBay has been formalised. This makes eBay India a Fipkart Group Company, along with names such as Myntra, Jabong, PhonePe, and Ekart.\n\nCommenting on the development, Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy said, “I’m delighted to welcome eBay.in, its employees, sellers, and partners into the Flipkart family.”\n\nReports of the merger first surfaced in April 2017, when Flipkart raised $1.4 Bn from funding from Tencent, Microsoft, and eBay. At the time, the startup had reportedly entered into a strategic commercial agreement with eBay. According to the contract, eBay made an undisclosed cash investment in exchange for an equity stake in Flipkart.\n\nRelated Article: eBay To Embark On A New Journey In India By Facilitating Exports For Sellers\n\nAs part of the merger deal, eBay also sold its Indian arm to the 10-year-old startup. At the time, eBay Inc President and CEO, Devin Wenig, told Inc42, “The combination of eBay’s position as a leading global ecommerce company and Flipkart’s market stature will allow us to accelerate and maximise the opportunity for both companies in India.”\n\nLater in June, Flipkart’s acquisition of eBay India received the approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Now that the transaction is complete, eBay.in will continue to operate as an independent entity.\n\nThe two entities have also signed a cross-border trade agreement, aimed at facilitating expansion into the global ecommerce market. As per the agreement, Flipkart customers will be offered access to a wide range of global brands available on the eBay platform. On the other hand, customers of eBay will have access to Indian products.\n\nKrishnamurthy added, “Being an early mover, eBay.in has a unique standing in the Indian ecommerce market, which is a great addition to Flipkart’s leadership position. Our coming together directly benefits Indian customers and sellers for whom we want to provide the best possible ecommerce experience. This is a step in that direction.”\n\nThis development comes a day after Flipkart and Snapdeal’s proposed merger fell through, amidst lack of consensus between Snapdeal’s minority shareholders. Talks between the two companies went on for more than five months before taking a downturn. As per reports, Snapdeal’s largest investor SoftBank is looking to jump ship with a $2 Bn investment in Flipkart.\n\nWhile Snapdeal is currently grappling with losses, layoffs, and an uncertain future, Flipkart is consolidating its efforts to head competition from Amazon. Now that the eBay India acquisition has been finalised, the homegrown ecommerce giant is one step closer to hitting profitability.", "entities": []}

SilverCloud first met with B Capital at an Enterprise Ireland-organised event last summer, which eventually led to this funding round, according to Ken Cahill, CEO (pictured). The VC firm had just begun investing in digital health by leading a round in US startup Edivation Health around that time.\n\nB Capital and its partnership with Boston Consulting will also help SilverCloud forge more relationships in the US market. “It made for a match made in heaven in terms of their global reach, access, network, and context,” said Cahill.\n\n“We’re looking to expand what we’re doing in the US. We have several health care providers and universities there. It’s really about building on that, expanding on that in a meaningful way.\n\n“The US is the largest healthcare market in the world without a doubt and really a key focus for us.”\n\nCurrently more than 120 healthcare organisations in Europe and North America are using the SilverCloud platform, including 45% of the NHS’s mental health services.\n\nOne of the key functions of the platform is addressing comorbidity. “Patients that have diabetes, 45% of them will also have clinical levels of depression, anxiety, or stress so there’s a huge comorbidity when you have the physical condition with mental health,” explained Cahill.\n\n“We’re about bringing the head and body together.

Additionally, it wants to build its tech and operations teams and has plans to expand its operation to new cities. The startup is also targeting to operate in New Delhi by early next year.\n\nThe company conducted field trials for more than nine months, developing Loca’s ride-sharing algorithm, before launching the services in April 2019. The startup was cofounded by Gautam Patil and Krishnakumar Ramachandran.\n\nIn a statement, the company highlighted that the micro-mobility market in India sees around 100 Mn trips per day, however, Loca feels that this market is unreliable and unaffordable currently.\n\nLoca also shared that it was this gap which encouraged the startup to set up local networks of shared mobility with a fleet of minivans and cars, dynamically routed based on real-time demand.\n\nThe company claims the average Loca user gets into a cab within 2.5 minutes of getting out of the metro, even during peak hours. He also believes that the service value at its current price point can help the company build a large scale set up across India.\n\nCurrently, Loca only operates from four Bengaluru metro stations –Indiranagar, Yelachenahalli, Mysore Road and Vijaynagar.\n\nRide-Sharing Market In India\n\nWith several Indian cities plagued by traffic congestion problem, there have been a rising demand for cab sharing startups. These services not only help the users to commute with ease but also reduces the number of cars on the road thereby cutting down on emissions and congestion.\n\nIn India, cab-aggregator companies Ola and Uber dominate the cab sharing market.\n\nBus ticketing startup redBus in June 2018 also entered the Indian carpooling space with the launch of its new vertical — rPool. Company’s rPool is integrated into the redBus app and currently operates in cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune.\n\nAccording to a 2019 Market Watch report, in 2018, the global carpooling market size stood at $4,250 Mn and it is expected to reach $11,400 Mn by the end of 2025, with a CAGR of 15.2%.

That’s likely because this was the first one. Northumberland CDFC is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing financing and strategy for entrepreneurs through a $5 million fund. Meanwhile the N100 (the name of the competition) awards higher risk ventures like UCIC with early-stage seed capital.\n\nUCIC won the five-month competition (which features startup challenges including a pitch contest) with its development of “Ubi” (the ubiquitous computer), a “revolutionary new device that will change how people interact with computers.”\n\n“We would like to congratulate UCIC as the first winner of N100, and we thank the 34 participating startups who responded to our global call with creative drive and entrepreneurial passion,” said Wendy Curtis of the Northumberland Community Futures Development Corporation. “N100 was designed to help transform ideas into investment-ready opportunities, and we look forward to the continuing evolution and growth of UCIC as the team sets out to achieve its next milestones—including shipping beta versions of the Ubi this fall to backers of their successful Kickstarter campaign.”\n\nNorthumberland County is situated on the north shore of Lake Ontario, in central Ontario. It is located east of the Regional Municipality of Durham, but before Belleville and Kingston.\n\nThe N100 competition was presented in partnership with Spark Centre and the N100 Power Panel. Spark Centre is the place where entrepreneurs, innovators, investors, researchers and students come together to form an innovation ecosystem, created by the Durham Strategic Energy Alliance. Spark Centre is one of fourteen not-for-profit Regional Innovation Centres (RICs) that form part of the Ontario Network of Entrepeneurs (ONE).

The team is made up of CEO Leor Grebler, Amin Abdossalami and Mahyar Fotoohi. Its first product, the Ubi, is a “revolutionary” new ubiquitous, voice-activated computing device that offers instant access to information and control of home automation devices. Equipped with a microphone, speakers and onboard sensors, it plugs into a wall outlet and accesses the Internet through a wifi connection. The Ubi listens for commands and monitors the environment, including temperature, humidity, air pressure, and ambient light. This data can be accessed online or used to trigger alerts through email or text message.\n\nGrebler said that the team was “thrilled” with the outcome of the competition. “We are witnessing the dawn of the era of ubiquitous computing and the internet of things,” he said. “UCIC and its partners are at the forefront with Ubi. We look forward to working closely with Northumberland CFDC to establish a centre of operations, create jobs and grow our presence and impact in Northumberland.”\n\nThere are more long acronyms below: take a deep breath.\n\nN100 is part of Northumberland CFDC’s startup acceleration toolkit, which also includes FedDev Ontario’s Scientists and Engineers in Business (SEB) Initiative in Northumberland.

If one removes these, the amount in disclosed VC deals more or less doubled from 2018.\n\nThe figure for 2019 however could well be a lot higher, as Ventureburn didn’t include figures for 15 deals which we reported on where the investment amounts were not disclosed (see the list of those deals, at the foot of this story).\n\nFintech still remains one of the hottest verticals in the country’s tech startup sector. In 2019 fintech (including crypto and insurtech) accounted for about a third of the value of investment, at R269.4-million invested in 13 disclosed deals.\n\nHere then are perhaps SA’s biggest 11 tech startup deals in 2019 (for the 12 we used the dollar-rand exchange rate at the time the deal was announced — which is why the figure below sums to R555-million — Ed):\n\nSA tech startup RapidDeploy announced in February that it had raised $12-million (about R167-million at the time) in a Series-A round from US venture capital fund GreatPoint Ventures and innovation fund Samsung Next (see this story). The startup did not reveal the stake that the two have taken in the company.\n\nThe funding will help the startup — which in January opened a new head office in the US (see this story) — to accelerate the development and deployment of its cloud aided platform, which enables public safety officials to reduce emergency response times and improve situational awareness.\n\nThe startup was founded by Brett Meyerowitz (pictured above, right) in 2014. He was later joined by fellow founder Steven Raucher (above left) who is now the CEO, in 2016.\n\nThis year proved quite a year for the startup. It opened a US office and also prepared to move to a bigger location in Cape Town (see here and here). It now employs almost 100 people – 62 in Cape Town and 35 in Austin, in the US.\n\nEarlier this month Raucher said the startup is looking to double its Cape Town staff numbers to 120 by the end of this year. Last month Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described at the Microsoft Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida (see this video clip) how RapidDeploy protects public safety and prevents ransomware attacks.\n\nCape Town based fintech startup Lulalend revealed in June that it had closed a $6.5-million (R90-million at the time) Series-A round led by the World Bank’s IFCand Quona Capital (see this story).\n\nThe startup, which was founded in 2014 by CTO Neil Welman and CEO Trevor Gosling (pictured above, left and right, respectively), provides short-term loans to small businesses via an online platform (it typically lends out R150 000 over a six-month term period).\n\nThe startup has had access to over R150-million in debt funding since launching in 2014 and is on track to access another R500-million off the back of the startup’s latest equity raise Gosling said in July (see this story).\n\nCape Town based on-demand domestic cleaning service SweepSouth, which was founded in 2014 by Aisha Pandor (pictured above) and Alen Ribic, announced in October that it raised more than R50-million in its latest funding round (see this story).\n\nPandor confirmed with Ventureburn today that the round was in fact over R60-million and included a R30-million investment from Naspers’s R1.4-billion venture capital (VC) fund Naspers Foundry, which was announced in June (see this story).\n\nInvestors in the over R60-million round included the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation which invested $1-million (R14.5-million) in the company.\n\nThe startup said in a statement at the time that Smollan, Vumela, CRE VC (previously Africa Angels Network) and musician and venture capitalist Black Coffee had also participated in the round.\n\nSweepSouth also said early investors Newtown Partners had exited the startup in the round with more than 10x return on their investment.\n\nCape Town based fintech company Nomanini in August announced that it had netted $4-million (about R57-million) in an investment round led by Standard Bank, with participation from Amsterdam-based investment firm Goodwell Investments (see this story).\n\nBoth investors have taken an undisclosed stake in the company.\n\nNomanini, which was founded in 2010 by Vahid Monadjem (pictured above) who serves as the company’s CEO, connects informal merchants with distributors via an e-wallet and physical device. Merchants can use the same device to offer basic banking services to their communities.\n\nThe fintech company said at the time that by investing in the company, Standard Bank will be able to use Nomanini’s platform to collect data on the informal retail economy.\n\nThe SA founders of biotech startup 3X4 Genetics this year landed $2.5-million in investment from US venture capital (VC) fund Alethea Capital Management (see this story).\n\nFounded by Jason Haddock, the former CTO of Cape Town animation studio Sea Monster, and scientist Yael Joffe (pictured above, left and right, respectively) in 2017, the startup offers genetic tests to patients via a network of health practitioners.\n\nHaddock told Ventureburn earlier this month that while the deal is for $2.5-million, the startup has the option to access an additional $2.5-million at a later stage.\n\nAs part of the agreement with San Diego based Alethea Capital’s Tony Hsu, 3X4 Genetics has had to move its intellectual property (IP) and the company itself, to the US. The company will now be based in Seattle, with the Cape Town based business becoming a subsidiary of the US company.\n\nIn 2017 the two pitched at genetics company Illumina’s accelerator. The startup subsequently netted an investment of R4.8-million from Earthchild founder Jared Kahn.\n\nHaddock says what differentiates the startup’s genetics test from those of competitors is that the test results focus significantly on what nutrition a patient can look at to improve their health.\n\nIn addition, results are packaged in a way so as to make it more useful for a patient looking to tackle a health issue, while bringing the patient and practitioner closer together. For instance, the genetics test results will detail things such how well your body processes toxins, or the health of one’s heart or brain.\n\nSA aerial-data analytics startup Aerobotics in February announced that it had received R29-million ($2-million) from local venture capital (VC) company Paper Plane Ventures in its latest round of funding (see this story).\n\nAerobotics’ various software products help farmers – by way of a web-based and artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled web platform and app – to scout and find areas of their vineyards of orchards that are underperforming because of pests or other problems.\n\nThe Cape Town based startup was founded by James Paterson and Benji Meltzer (pictured above, left and right, respectively) in 2014.\n\nThe latest funding follows a $2-million round led by Nedbank in May last year (the deal was announced in July 2018 — see here) and an R8-million round in 2017 from SA VC 4Di Capital and the Savannah Fund in Kenya (see this story).\n\nCape Town edtech company Snapplify announced in September that it had raised $2-million (over R29-million) in expansion capital (see this story).\n\nThe money was raised from two SA funds — venture capital firm Knife Capital via its SA Revenue Service (Sars) Section 12J Venture Capital Company, KNF Ventures, and black empowerment investment manager Hlayisani Capital’s Hlayisani Growth Fund.\n\nAt the time Knife Capital said the investment will accelerate Snapplify’s international expansion initiatives and advance its data analytics capabilities to enhance classroom teaching effectiveness.\n\nSnapplify, which was founded in 2011 by Wesley Lynch (pictured above, second from right), offers elearning solutions to over 1400 schools, colleges and universities that are striving towards digital learning and the use of ebooks in the classroom.\n\nCape Town based insurtech startup Inclusivity Solutions in June announced that it had raised $1.56-million in a Series-A round led by Amsterdam-based impact investment and advisory firm Goodwell Investments.\n\nGoodwell Investments, which made the investment through its €100-million Sub-Sahara Africa focused uMunthu Fund, said in a statement that Allan Gray, RGAx (a subsidiary of Reinsurance Group of America) and other angel investors, it did not name, participated in the round.\n\nThe startup was founded in 2015 by CEO Jeremy Leach (pictured above). It designs, builds and operates inclusive digital insurance solutions (see this story).\n\nIn January, Johannesburg based proptech startup Flow announced that it had raised R20-million, from Kalon Venture Partners and an undisclosed US venture capital (VC) fund.\n\nAt the time Kalon Venture Partners CEO Clive Butkow said there was no conflict of interest in the deal that his VC company participated in. This, despite Flow CEO Gil Sperling being a board member of Butkow’s VC fund (see this story).\n\nFlow’s app allows tenants to get rewarded for things such as paying their rent on time and looking after their homes. Tenants get points every month that they can then use to access rewards from providers such as Superbalist, Weylandts, SweepSouth, OneCart, plus a selection of airtime and electricity providers.\n\nThe startup was founded by Sperling (pictured above, middle) Daniel Levy (above, right) and Jonathan Liebmann (above, left) in 2017.\n\nPretoria-based citizen engagement platform GovChat in May said it had secured an investment facility from JSE-listed firm Capital Appreciation, that will allow the start to tap up to R20-million in funding from the listed company (see this story).\n\nGovChat said the Capital Appreciation, which invests in fintech businesses, made the investment through its enterprise development fund — which in terms of the BEE scorecard allows companies that lend to black-owned or black-empowered firms to score BEE points.\n\nGovChat was founded in 2016 and launched last year by CEO Eldrid Jordaan (pictured above). Just under 500 000 South Africans currently use the platform.\n\nJohannesburg-based Bitcoin SV (BSV) wallet and merchant payment startup Centbee in April announced that it had raised £1-million from Ayra Ventures founder Calvin Ayre (see this story).\n\nCentbee was founded in 2017 by co-CEOs Angus Brown and Lorien Gamaroff (pictured above, left to right). Gamaroff is a leading expert in blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, while Brown — the former CEO of eBucks.com — has 20 years’ experience in payments and banking.\n\nThe deal was facilitated by blockchain advisory, research and development firm nChain which last year in January took an equity stake in Centbee. The size of that deal was not disclosed.\n\nAll the other SA deals\n\nThe 19 other disclosed deals were:\n\nFlexClub (fintech): R17.3m\n\nCoindirect (crypto investment): R15.8m\n\nDigsConnect (proptech): R12m\n\nRevix (crypto investment): R11m\n\nYellow (pay-as-you-go solar-power devices): R10.5m\n\nInvestSure (insurtech): R9.6m\n\nSmartBlade (medtech) R9.5m\n\nHealthcent (healthtech) R8m\n\nuKheshe (fintech): R7m\n\nIntergreatme (regtech): R6m\n\nThe Sun Exchange (fintech): R4.2m\n\nFincheck (fintech): R4.4m\n\nThe Sun Exchange (fintech): R3.6m)\n\nGotBot (AI): R2.5m\n\nFancam (photo platform): R1.4m\n\nPocketJam (blockchain): R1.1m\n\nDentX (repair platform): R1m)\n\nDigemy (HR platform): R1m)\n\nBulrush Agritech (agritech): R250k\n\nThose deals 15 that were not undisclosed include: My-iMali, Khula, Solvency, Droppa, Nobuntu, Ozow, Guidepost, Payabill, Ovex, Sentian, Yebo Fresh, SnapnSave, HouseMe, Jonga and Green Machine.\n\nRead more: Are these the 10 biggest deals by African tech startups in 2019?\n\nRead more: Are these SA’s 10 biggest disclosed VC deals so far in 2019?

{"text": "German Startups Group invests in Bezahlt.de – the new FinTech startup of Kreditech founder Sebastian Diemer.\n\nThe VC firm German Startups Group today announced it invested in the FinTech startup Bezahlt.de / Blackbill and increased its stake in the e-commerce startup Juniqe. The Berlin-based investor is developing a “patient capital” approach that recently became kind of popular due to the fact that it can generate higher returns in the VC segment.\n\nThe new portfolio company Bezahlt.de/Blackbill offers factoring solutions for freelancers, self-employed entrepreneurs as well as small and medium-sized enterprises. The Bezahlt.de/Blackbill platform has just been launched with the goal to carry out the risk assessment automatically within seconds for the first time and to reduce the default risk so that by, for example, simply taking a picture of an outgoing invoice with a mobile phone the invoice amount can be collected almost immediately. The startup asserts, that up until now this market segment has not been sufficiently addressed since individual risk assessments cause high costs. The founding team – four members – has 13 years of FinTech experience. They employ already established scoring concepts and achieves lower costs and process complexities through digitalisation and automation.\n\nThe founding team around CEO Sebastian Diemer has already collectively built one of the most successful German FinTech startups (Kreditech), which offers private loans on the basis of a data-driven scoring model. Further investors in Bezahlt.de/Blackbill are, among others, Point Nine Capital und Fly Ventures.\n\nGerman Startups Group CEO Christoph Gerlinger comments on the investment in Blackbill: “Through Blackbill we expand our portfolio by another very promising investment in this sector. Sebastian Diemer and his team have previously demonstrated that they are proven big data experts in the FinTech segment. Blackbill now tackles an entirely new, very attractive FinTech segment. We are convinced that team will be successful again and that they can grow considerably in the coming years.”\n\nGerman Startups Group also has increased its stake in Juniqe – a lifestyle brand for handpicked and affordable art. Designs of international artists are offered on posters and prints for walls as well as on shirts, stationery, and home textiles by the online shop. The production is made to order, which is why the business model does not require a large inventory and generates higher margins. Juniqe already ships, according to the company, to 13 European countries. It grew 190% p.a. on average in revenue and achieved a double-digit million revenue already in 2015. Juniqe was ranked first on CB Insights’ list of “15 High Momentum German Early Stage Startups” in August 2015. The founders appeared on the Forbes list “30 Under 30” in the category of retail and e-commerce in January 2016. EU-Startups.com named it among the 10 German startups to look out for in 2016.\n\nGerman Startups Group has already invested in Juniqe with the Series A financing round. The increase of the stake is a result of investor’s approach to invest in promising companies, particularly of serial entrepreneurs, as well as in early stage companies and companies with limited employment of capital. The investors intend to gradually increase the investment in case of positive growth indicators. This is unreservedly possible since German Startups Group does not provide its capital in the form of venture capital funds with limited terms, but as an investment company and therefore “evergreen”. This approach has recently become known as “patient capital” in the US.", "entities": [[0, 21, "investor"], [33, 43, "org_in_focus"], [122, 143, "investor"], [144, 149, "date_of_funding"], [195, 205, "org_in_focus"], [208, 217, "org_in_focus"], [280, 286, "headquarters_loc"]]}

The app itself was co-created through a multi-sectoral partnership with charities including the Heart & Stroke Foundation, Diabetes Canada, and YMCA, and select loyalty partners SCENE, Aeroplan, Petro Points, Drop, and More Rewards.\n\nFollowing BC, Carrot then launched in Newfoundland & Labrador, and Ontario just three months ago.\n\nThe platform awards points to users from programs like Aeroplan and Petro-Points for completing tasks like walking a certain number of steps or taking quizzes on healthy living and personal finance.\n\n“Ontario is happy to support the Carrot Rewards app,” said Dr. Eric Hoskins, Ontario’s Health Minister. “It’s an innovative platform that encourages people to be active and eat healthy. Our government is committed to help Ontarians manage their own health through the use of new, user-friendly digital tools like this one.”\n\nEleanor McMahon, Ontario Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport; Jane Rooney, Financial Literacy Leader of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada; Andreas Souvaliotis, founder and CEO of Carrot Insights; and personal finance expert Bruce Sellery were present during an announcement at the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto.\n\n“We are proud to be touching so many lives in our home province, so quickly,” says Andreas Souvaliotis, founder and CEO of Carrot Insights. “Ontarians are embracing Carrot even faster than we’ve seen elsewhere – and the impact, in terms of potential behaviour change, is truly remarkable. We are inspiring so many of our fellow citizens to be more physically active and to learn so much more about their health and wellness.”\n\nThe Ministers also announced that the Carrot Rewards app also has 200,00 Ontarians on the platform, and one percent of Canadians on the platform.

The round was led by Scale Venture Partners, with participation from prior investors, including New Enterprise Associates and Pelion Venture Partners. The investment allows Stormpath to scale its business to support the fast-growing demand for its powerful Identity API for web applications and services. Andy Vitus, Partner at Scale Venture Partners, will be joining the company's board.\n\nWith the emergence of mobile, IoT, and API technologies, the need for customer identity as a service has never been greater. User workloads, including authentication and authorization, are time-consuming, introduce risk and distract teams from core product development. In order to meet the enterprise's high expectations for customer experience and security, Forrester recommends that businesses 'dump home-grown approaches for managing customer identities,' in favor of services like Stormpath. [1]\n\n'We have long advocated for developer services as one of the easiest ways for software engineering teams to gain efficiency,' said Vitus. 'For almost as long, we have kept an eye out for a company that handles the authentication and authorization of an application's users. Stormpath elegantly centralizes identity into a service, enabling developers to focus on building the application they imagine.'\n\nA pioneer in the Customer Identity API space, Stormpath, launched in 2011, powers customer identity infrastructure for thousands of web applications and services from startups to the enterprise. The API and supporting libraries offer software teams a complete identity layer that reduces security risk and allows them to launch products faster. It can connect a user's identity across applications, services and devices to give customers a seamless experience across one or many digital products and devices.\n\n'Stormpath handles the Single Sign-On across our properties and worked closely with our dev team. It saved our team time, and means we won't have to reinvent the wheel with each new application,' said Chris McCooey, VP of Engineering, Media at Purch, the publisher of sites such as Tom's Hardware.\n\nBuilt by security experts, Stormpath has focused heavily on system security and performance to support unpredictable customer workloads across devices. With support for multiple authentication types (Web, Mobile, API or IoT) and a best-in-class authorization support, Stormpath offers software engineering teams a complete and reliable user infrastructure they can reuse across applications.\n\n'We are seeing a rapid expansion of web and mobile services,' said Alex Salazar, Stormpath CEO. 'Companies everywhere must offer digital services to win customer attention, and they must be prepared to scale that customer experience without warning. The Stormpath Identity API allows businesses to launch their web applications and services faster, and with better user security.

{"text": "Road to Succes: Daniel Gebler on how he made Picnic deliver the goods.\n\nGetting in that CEO or CTO position doesn’t happen overnight. Everybody started somewhere – be it a dusty garage like Jobs and Wozniak, a cluttered dorm room like Zuckerberg or, like many young minds of today, in a coworking space without money but a mind full of ideas. In this new series on Silicon Canals we interview successful entrepreneurs about their road to success: what does it take to get to the top, especially at a young age? First up: Daniel Gebler of on demand online supermarket Picnic.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nBooming\n\nOn demand startups are booming. The convenience of getting your stuff delivered where and when you want, is getting more popular everyday in the digital age. While UberEats, Deliveroo, TakeAway and Foodora battle it out when it comes to delivering your dinner, Picnic conveniently delivers your groceries as well. Picnic is not a delivery service for existing supermarkets; it’s a supermarket that only exists online. Because of the low overhead, Picnic can deliver at regular, affordable prices.\n\nImpressive resume\n\nPicnic’s CTO Daniel Gebler has an impressive resume with a PhD in Computer Science, two masters in both Computer Science and Business Administration and even a short stint at Stanford. After his studies, the talented whizkid became a postdoc researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and was the director of R&D at software company Fredhopper, where he started a few years earlier as a software architect. With this background, it looks like Gebler was preparing for a managing position from an early age. “Early on I was interested in both technology and business,” Gebler says. “During high school I was actively involved in the demoscene where value gets created by finding the right mash-up. Hence, it was just natural to follow two master studies. Studying for two degrees simultaneously also offers you a practical lesson in effective project and time management.”\n\nBusiness or academics\n\nWhen Gebler chose to pursue a PhD in Computer Sciences, he had not yet decided if he wanted to make a career in business, academics or both. “I knew that most successful technology ventures combine latest science with cutting edge engineering. Therefore, I had to become deeply invested in science as well. After finishing my PhD I stayed actively involved in academics. This helps us now to get exceptional talent from top Dutch and European universities.”\n\nFredhopper\n\nAfter his PhD, the young IT prodigy started as a software architect at Fredhopper. In a few years he worked his way up to a development manager and quickly became director of R&D – two big promotions in just a few years. “I absolutely loved the product and was very fortunate to work with an exceptional team that shared my vision. Then it just became natural to take on more responsibilities. We had a really great time by building a culture around engineering excellence. As a result, we formed a very strong and lasting team that became one of the most valuable tech networks in this country.”\n\nUnprecedented potential\n\nJust like Picnic, Fredhopper works on targeting software to optimise the shelves in online stores. While at this company, Gebler made some important connections and gained some vital insights that proved to be helpful when starting Picnic: “I worked closely with leading E-commerce companies such as ASOS, Debenhams, HP, Otto.de, Toys’R Us, and Urban Outfitters. From those projects I gained deep insights into all aspects of digital shelving which now forms the basis of our online store. However, Picnic operates also a whole supply chain including an entire warehouse and a fleet of delivery vans. The integration of store and supply chain systems is a very exciting new dimension that opens up unprecedented potential to optimize in real-time merchandising, trading, and operations. We can unlock this potential in Picnic since we rethought the entire supply chain independently from the legacy of bricks-and-mortar stores.”\n\nResearcher\n\nGebler left Fredhopper in 2011 to go back to the academic field. For three years he became a postdoc researcher at VU University. He chose to take the academic path again in order to get a fresh look at the long term trends of software engineering and software science. “Over the last 20 years, software engineering evolved mainly by process improvements like Agile, Lean, Scrum, and Kanban. However, there is exciting new research in AI for software engineering and software correctness by construction. This will fundamentally change the way how we build software products. In the broader context, this research has the potential to converge and marry software engineering and data science. Then software product engineering becomes a new process of composing AI modules that are configured by supervised and unsupervised learning.”\n\nAlways be at the core of a company\n\nWhen we ask this successful founder for the most valuable lessons he has learned as CTO of a startup, he has a clear answer straight away “One of the best pieces of advice I got early on was to work at the core of a company: If it is a product company, then be a product engineer, product owner or product operator. If it is a service company, then do the service for some time and later productize it. Another great learning was that after your idea is validated, stick to it and focus on execution.”\n\nKey ingredients of a successful startup\n\nWhen asked for the definition of a successful startup, the Picnic founder has a handy shopping list with key ingredients ready: “The key ingredients of a successful startup are an exceptional team, a great product, and a major market opportunity. Product adoption, commercial success, and societal impact all depend on execution and timing. At Picnic we define success by how much money our customers save when shopping with us, how much time they win back, and how much ease it brings to their lives when a routine task like grocery shopping becomes a job well done.”\n\nThe importance of having flawless analytics in place\n\nWhen thinking about things he could have done better, Gebler points at Picnic’s analytics. Although they function great now, it wasn’t always like that: “One of the really interesting lessons we learned is related to the different maturity requirements of consumer products vs. data analytics systems. While customers are happy to give feedback on an early version of your product, the analytics and reporting systems need to be flawless and robust from day one. Initially we aimed for building the analytics across all our products, services and systems in one go. It quickly became clear that we needed to focus on the mission-critical operational systems first and on the strategic and growth systems later. By now our engineering process ensures that each product feature and operational change has analytics and performance measurements in place at the time of launch.”\n\nAdvice for other young entrepreneurs\n\nWith hs vast experience, Gebler obviously has handy advice for his fellow entrepreneurs: “I would give the following advice based on the key dimensions of market, product, and team. Play to win instead of play to not lose. Build a strong product and market vision and take external advisory with a grain of salt. Build the right team, nurture it with a strong technology vision, and then get out of their way and let them build it. Establish a champion mindset but stay humble and don’t fall into the trap of arrogance from early success. Last but not least, enjoy the journey and get comfortable with the unknown.”\n\nClear idea\n\nGebler has a clear idea for his future and that of Picnic. “There are many exciting technology trends like AI, IoT, mobile, finance and quantified self that will shape the coming years. I’m looking forward to push these technologies to the next level and use them for impactful products that customers love”.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Underground Cellar Secures Backing From Famous 'Shark Tank' Investor Barbara Corcoran.\n\nClever Wine Startup Part of Off-Camera Deals Lady-Shark is Making in High-Growth Companies Prior to Season 6 of ABC’s Hit Reality Series, ‘Shark Tank’\n\nSAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–September 17, 2014–\n\nUnderground Cellar today announced it has raised $1,000,000USD in investor funding, with the most recent contribution coming from famous ‘Shark Tank’ investor Barbara Corcoran. As part of the deal, Corcoran is also featuring Underground Cellar in her VC fund, Barbara Corcoran Venture Partners, which can be found on AngelList at https://angel.co/underground-cellar. The fund, which recommends companies Corcoran feels are worthy of investment, opens the door to accredited investors to invest alongside her in high-growth companies she is investing in. Underground Cellar, through this deal, is seeking an additional $200,000USD to expand their growing userbase and attract additional premium wineries onto its platform.\n\nUnderground Cellar is led by 28-year-old CEO and Founder Jeffrey Shaw, bringing sommelier-curated wine collections to buyers’ doors. The site’s unique features include randomly upgrading purchases to limited-edition, rare-vintage, and autographed large-format bottles, as well as unlimited free wine storage that allows buyers to pick and choose bottles from their collection to be shipped out on-demand at any time. Since launching UndergroundCellar.com in April 2014, Shaw has not only raised $1,000,000USD in investor funding, but has also built a 10-person team based in San Francisco, CA and sold over half a million dollars worth of wine.\n\n“It’s really great that high-profile investors such as Barbara Corcoran are taking advantage of the latest SEC rules,” says Shaw. “It’s allowing those interested in getting their feet wet with startup investing to get expert guidance from those they trust. And it’s working – within just hours after Barbara recommended us to her backers, we’ve already attracted over 60 new investments in Underground Cellar and they keep coming in.”\n\nBarbara Corcoran’s exposure on the TV show ‘Shark Tank’ provides her access to unprecedented deal flow, giving those who back her syndicated fund unique opportunities to invest in innovative companies with tremendous growth potential. Her investments run the gamut from ingenious consumer products to disruptive technologies.\n\n“What I look for in picking companies to invest in are all-star teams with proven pedigrees and a track record of success,” says Corcoran. “That’s why I’m excited to be investing in Underground Cellar.”\n\nAbout Underground Cellar\n\nUnderground Cellar is an innovative online wine marketplace for discovering and buying premium wine that randomly rewards consumers with free bottle swap-outs to rare and private-stash bottles from prestigious wineries. Members can increase their chance of being upgraded to a higher-value bottle by referring friends, purchasing wine, and participating in discussions with other users.

{"text": "Updated: Rocket Internet Backed Jabong Looks For A New CEO; Mohan & Praveen Sinha To Exit.\n\nUpdate: Post publishing this news, we got following official response from Jabong:\n\n“Arun Chandra Mohan, CEO and co-founder has decided to pursue a new business venture and has resigned from Jabong by mutual agreement. We are in the process of hiring a CEO and in the interim the buying and sourcing functions will be led by Nils Chrestin, CFO of the Global Fashion Group. Praveen Sinha, MD and co-founder will continue to lead all functions at Jabong. We are thankful to Arun for his many contributions to Jabong. We wish him all the best for all his future endeavors.”\n\nBefore:\n\nRocket Internet backed fashion ecommerce company, Jabong is reportedly looking for a new CEO. According to a report, current CEO and co-founder, Arun Chandra Mohan and Managing Director and co-founder, Praveen Sinha are moving out of the company.\n\nMohan has confirmed that he is moving from the company and also mentioned that he will be working on his new venture in the internet mobile segment.\n\nWe have reached out to Praveen Sinha for the same, his reply is awaited.\n\nWhile Mohan is expected to leave the company this month, Praveen will exit the company by the year end.\n\nLast year, two of its co-founders, Mukul Bafana and Manu had also left the company. Post that, Jabong had raised $100 Mn funding round and since January 2015, investors have pumped in over $45 Mn (INR 300 Cr.) in the company, according to the documents filed with the Registrar of Companies.\n\nA source close to the development told Mint that the hunt for a new CEO is on from a month. He further added, “The global team has given the mandate to an international executive search firm.”\n\nEarlier in July, we have reported that two will be moving to new roles with Rocket Internet, but, according to the source, both are moving out of Rocket.\n\nIn a separate development, Jabong has recently shut its design office in London and has also fired 10-15 people from the London team, under pressure from the parent company. Earlier this year, the company had also announced its plans to launch firm’s first technology lab in Bangalore.\n\nIn April this year, Jabong was merged with Global Fashion Group (GFG), formed out of five Kinnevik and Rocket Internet-backed online fashion startups active across dozens of emerging markets. These include Dafiti (Latin America), Jabong (India), Lamoda (Russia and CIS), Namshi (Middle East) and Zalora (South East Asia and Australia). The merged entity had also raised $35 Mn funding round led by Tengelmann Ventures and Verlinvest.\n\nCurrently, Jabong offers 190,000 products from more than 1,800 brands. The company faces fierce competition from Myntra which was acquired by Flipkart last year. Jabong is also under pressure from the parent company for losses and has been asked to cut down expenses.\n\nWell this is not something new in context of Rocket Internet portfolio companies in the country. In the past few months, number of people from the top management team of Rocket’s companies have moved out. Recently, Fabfurnish cofounders, Mehul Agrawal and Vikram Chopra have left the company and prior to that, Foodpanda founder, Rohit Chadda had also stepped down.\n\nRocket Internet also has a history of shifting roles within its group, for instance, earlier in March, Saurabh Kochhar, who was CEO at Printvenue was appointed India CEO of another Rocket Internet company, Foodpanda. Later, Rocket had appointed Printvenue Co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Gagan Arora as the CEO.", "entities": []}

The company backs many respectable and big names in SaaS such as Aircall, Spendesk and Front. And, to speed up the workflow, the company requires electronic signatures, which is why it has partnered with the French e-signature company.\n\nWhile there are many well-established players in this segment such as HelloSign, DocuSign, Adobe Sign, SignNow, etc., none of these companies have created an impact that YouSign has managed to leave. Founded in 2013 by Luc Pallavidino, this startup offers features that one will expect. Well, it lets uploading a document, setting up automated emails and sending notifications for everyone to sign the document. Yousign archives documents and lets users create document templates and send contract proposals via an API.\n\nBut the major challenge faced by the company is that Europe is quite fragmented and it has to convince users in various countries to switch to e-signatures. This has been facilitated by the partnership with eFounders as Yousign is now available in the UK, Germany, Spain and of course, France.\n\nIn a blog post, Thibaud Elziere, the CEO of eFounders stated, “eFounders has acquired around 50% of the company through an SPV (Single Purpose Vehicle) that it controls.

As part of the funding round, David Jegen, partner at F-Prime Capital, will join Unison's board of directors.\n\n\n\nThe investment underscores the growing consumer demand for alternative home financing solutions, as well as Unison's success in modernizing residential real estate for consumers and institutional investors. Unison has two programs: HomeBuyer increases housing affordability and purchasing power for prospective home buyers by doubling to quadrupling their down payment, and HomeOwner allows existing home owners to easily unlock a portion of their home equity without borrowing. Both programs enable consumers to use the money provided by Unison for up to 30 years without interest or monthly payments.\n\n\n\n\"I built Unison with home buyers, home owners and institutional investors top of mind and to bridge two massive needs: provide a form of capital for consumers and make residential real estate an investable asset class. In the build out, Unison was forced to ride out the market collapse, which only strengthened our resolve and solidified our belief that the platform could survive anything,\" said Thomas Sponholtz, CEO of Unison. \"Now a decade later, we are the leaders in the home ownership investment category. We have brought together government officials, lenders, institutional investors and other thought leaders to solve America's home affordability crisis. By providing the only new way to finance a home since the mortgage was introduced in 1781, we are liberating consumers from debt-only solutions that have saturated the marketplace.\"\n\n\n\nUnison has earmarked the capital to fuel growth in new and existing markets, build brand awareness, expand business operations, acquire new talent and further advance its technology platform.\n\n\n\n\"As housing affordability continues to decrease, especially in urban areas, Unison brings a new financial solution for home ownership that benefits consumers, lenders and institutional investors,\" said Arvind Purushotham, Managing Director and co-Head of Venture Investing at Citi Ventures. \"We're excited to join Unison on its mission of providing home owners with accessible financing options.\"\n\n\n\nUnison Series B funding closely follows several achievements, including a 1,000 percent increase in Q1 2018 YoY growth. In addition, the company recently expanded the availability of its programs, bringing its total reach to 22 states, and welcomed CMO Cari Jacobs and Head of Engineering Quintin Gomez to its management team.\n\n\n\nAbout Unison Home Ownership Investors\n\nUnison is the leading provider of home ownership investments, modernizing home financing through long-term partnerships. Unison works with lenders, regulators and institutional investors to integrate home ownership investing into the U.S. housing finance system. Unison HomeBuyer helps purchasers buy the home they want with less debt and risk, typically by doubling the down payment. The larger down payment makes it easier to qualify for a loan, increases buying power, lowers the monthly payment and/or allows a buyer to reserve cash. Unison HomeOwner provides current homeowners with cash to eliminate debt, remodel, pay for school, invest or as a cash cushion, without the added debt or payments of a home equity loan or HELOC.\n\n\n\nUnison's platforms have received prestigious recognitions including the FinovateSpring 2017 and Benzinga 2017 Best of Show awards. Headquartered in San Francisco, Unison operates in 22 states plus Washington D.C.

After quietly raising a $50 million Series C funding round from Union Square Ventures and Greenspring Associates, with existing investors NEA, Pelion Venture Partners, and Venrock participating, the company has blown away expectations to become part of the critical infrastructure of the web.\n\n\n\n'The web is about to turn 25 years old and it's beginning to show its age,' said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of CloudFlare. 'Whether you're building a traditional website, a complex online application, or the next great mobile app you need to be backed by a fast, secure network. CloudFlare has built that next generation network and is democratizing the resources that were previously available only to the Internet giants.'\n\n\n\nCloudFlare has become the standard for Internet performance and security, today powering more than five percent of all web requests. In 2013, CloudFlare stopped over 50 billion attacks including the Internet's largest DDoS attack. This year, CloudFlare doubled its customer count to more than 1.5 million -- ranging from Fortune 100 companies and national governments to small businesses and mobile app startups. The customers contributed to a 450 percent increase in CloudFlare's year-over-year revenues.\n\n\n\n'At Union Square Ventures we have always believed in the transformative power of the Internet. Until recently, we have naively believed that the Internet would always be there and always be available,' explained Brad Burnham, Managing Partner at Union Square Ventures. 'We now know that the great strength of the Internet -- its openness -- also makes it vulnerable to malware, denial of service, and other forms of attack. We are thrilled to be working with CloudFlare to harness the collective power of the Internet to defend the network from these attacks. Importantly for us, CloudFlare's approach does this without sacrificing the values of openness and permissionless innovation that have made the Internet such an important engine of economic growth.'\n\n\n\n'When NEA first invested in CloudFlare in 2011, I thought it was one of the most exciting companies I'd ever seen,' said Scott Sandell, General Partner at NEA. 'That conviction has only increased with the company's continued technological innovation and extraordinary growth. Matthew and his team have not only revolutionized network security and performance, they are in the process of helping reinventing the Internet itself. And from a business perspective, their growth rivals the trajectories of the best SaaS companies.'\n\n\n\nWith the capital infusion from its series C round that closed in December 2012, CloudFlare quadrupled its network capacity across 23 global data centers and established an engineering office in London. The company plans to continue its rapid network expansion in 2014 with new data center locations coming soon in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and China.\n\n\n\nAbout CloudFlare\n\nCloudFlare, Inc. (www.cloudflare.com / @cloudflare) makes sites twice as fast, protects them from attacks, ensures they are always online, and makes it simple to add web apps with a single click. CloudFlare supercharges websites regardless of size or platform with no need to add hardware, install software, or change a line of code.

The company's solution, which is built from the ground up for networks, brings the benefits of AI-augmented operations, planning and orchestration to physical, virtual and cloud network environments. The funding will enable Augtera to expand operations to support existing and rapidly growing production deployments across Global 1000 companies, scale strategic partnerships and accelerate adoption.\n\nBain Capital Ventures led the round with participation from aCrew Capital. With this announcement Enrique Salem, partner at Bain Capital Ventures and former CEO of Symantec, joins Augtera's board of directors.\n\nAs enterprises, cloud and service providers continue to adopt software defined networking, data center fabric designs, hybrid cloud and white box switches, networks have become increasingly complex, fragmented and difficult to operate. As a result supporting business agility and providing network uptime necessary for increased revenue growth, while minimizing operational expense, have become significant pain points for network designers and operators alike. Augtera's product provides a holistic solution to this problem by applying machine learning to networking data and enables multiple orders of magnitude of benefit while addressing these pain points.\n\n\"The current paradigm of building and operating networks relies on engineering and operations teams to manually mine and find needles in an increasingly large and multi-layered haystack of data,\" said Rahul Aggarwal, founder and CEO, Augtera Networks. \"These teams are not able to leverage the richness of the network data and their work flows are reactive while serving applications, customers and users that depend on the network,\" continues Aggarwal. \"Augtera's proprietary AI technology powered by a holistic network model, finds the needles in the haystack automatically and proactively and enables a paradigm shift.\"\n\n\"Networks have become highly complicated, and management solutions to date have not kept up,\" said Salem. \"Augtera has built a ground-breaking AI system with algorithms designed specifically for networks, and we are already witnessing the efficacy and commercial potential of its highly-differentiated product in a number of customer environments. As an early investor, we are thrilled to partner with Rahul and Bhupesh and look forward to playing an active part in the company's growth and success.\"\n\n\"We are excited to be partnering with Rahul and Bhupesh, who bring world class domain expertise that is needed to unlock the tremendous value of applying machine learning to the networking domain. We look forward to our journey ahead with them,\" said Theresia Gouw, co-founder of aCrew Capital.\n\nFounded by industry veterans Rahul Aggarwal and Bhupesh Kothari, Augtera has developed proprietary algorithms with over two years of R&D to apply machine learning to the networking domain. These algorithms have been built and matured using production data from nine very large scale networks. AI applications that leverage these algorithms are custom built for networking constructs. These AI applications are powered by Augtera's platform, which provides the data plumbing, network models, scale, visualization, ecosystem integration and agility needed to bring the benefits of AI to complex and dynamic networking environments.\n\nAbout Augtera\n\nAugtera Networks is the provider of industry's first AI platform built from the ground up for networks.

{"text": "Five SA angel investors you want to meet.\n\nIf you’re a startup and you need money the chances are you are going to look to friends and relatives for help. Or you could try an angel investor.\n\nAngel investors often choose to operate in the shadows, as a silent investor — which means it is difficult to measure exactly how many such investors South Africa has.\n\nA 2017 VC survey (opens as PDF) by the Southern African Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (Savca) revealed that angel investors invested R89-million in deals in 2015 and 2016.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016 angel investors disclosed 112 deals to the value of R122-million. The value of deals still invested in by angel investors stood at R271-million last year, according to the survey.\n\nVentureburn looks at some of South Africa’s more publicly know angel investors. Here they are:\n\nMichael Jordaan\n\nFormer FNB boss and South African venture capitalist Michael Jordaan has invested in about 20 startups. But let’s get right to the point. The money is no more.\n\nLast month he announced on his blog that Montegray Capital, through which he invests, was fully invested and was not accepting any more applications for funding.\n\n“For understandable reasons we are not disclosing the amounts but in most cases these were small investments appropriate for businesses with an operating track record of two years or less,” he told Ventureburn in an email earlier this month (see the full story here).\n\nSome of the startups the Stellenbosch based Jordaan has invested in (through his venture capital company Montegray Capital) include Rain, South Africa’s first data-focused cellphone network, Snapplify.com which solves textbook deliveries by making textbooks available online and SA mobility startup GoMetro.\n\nOh and he’s also involved in setting up a digital bank, Bank Zero, in South Africa, which he aims to launch later this year (see more here).\n\nWhile he does not plan to start a second fund himself Jordaan said earlier this month that he has been approached by Hlayisani Capital to chair their Investment Committee.\n\nBrett Dawson\n\nFormer Dimension Data head Brett Dawson last month unveiled a new investment company Campan which will hold his angel investments. At present he has invested in six tech startups, including three founded by South Africans living overseas.\n\nAmong the six are Gather Online, a social networking site in which he has invested R10-million and Wrapistry which provides the ultimate gifting experience. Dawson was involved with Genesis Capital in a deal that saw the two invest R4-million in Wrapistry in November last year (see Ventureburn’s earlier story here).\n\nDawson would not disclose the investment amount and details of all five of the deals (he has only disclosed that of Gather Online, while Wrapistry deal size was disclosed by the founder himself).\n\nDawson, who is also involved in investing in tech startups via 12J venture capital (VC) company Anuva Investments, says his vision for Campan is to become a leading incubation platform that nurtures emerging, transformational Fourth Industrial Revolution businesses to make a real difference to society.\n\nAbu Cassim\n\nAbu Cassim is the founder and director of angel investor network Jozi Angels, which he helped start in 2015.

No financial terms were disclosed.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nNew York, January 9, 2018 – Branford Castle, a New York-based private equity firm, today announced the acquisition of Vitrek, LLC, a leading manufacturer of highly sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment based near San Diego, CA. The acquisition is the fourth for its fund that closed in late 2016.\n\n“We are moving rapidly to deploy our investors’ capital, and Vitrek represents an exciting growth opportunity,” said David Castle, Managing Partner of Branford Castle Partners. “We are especially pleased to be partnering again with Don Millstein, who is taking over as Operating Executive and Chairman of Vitrek. Don previously partnered with Branford Castle as President of E-Mon, a leading manufacturer of electrical sub-metering equipment that Branford sold for an 11x return.”\n\nThe transaction follows Branford’s acquisition of Surface Preparation Technologies, the United States’ leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety; Earthlite Massage Tables, the world’s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries; and Continuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.\n\nVitrek, founded in 1990, is known for its line of high potential (hipot) testers, high voltage meters and power analyzers. These products measure electrical safety, power consumption, and other characteristics of electricity in the context of the development, testing and manufacture of a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. Vitrek has significant market share in the United States, with most of its competitors manufacturing overseas.\n\nKevin Clark, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vitrek, said the company serves a diverse group of customers, including premier brands in the electrical, electronics, medical, cable, power, lighting and consumer appliance sectors. “Customers use our equipment to test their electrical products during the development stage and also in mass production. Vitrek’s power analyzers aid design engineers in improving the power efficiency of their products. At the mass production stage, Vitrek’s electrical safety testers confirm that end-users will be protected from “electrical shock” when using that product,” he said.\n\nMillstein has created a strategic plan to grow Vitrek through multiple avenues. “We plan to establish a comprehensive sales and marketing program to begin to access or further penetrate growth markets and to formalize OEM program opportunities,” he said. “We also want to expand the product line and launch an electronic component distribution program.” Millstein will take over as CEO when Clark retires after an appropriate transition period.\n\nLaurence Lederer, Managing Director of Branford Castle, said, “Vitrek continues our focus on acquiring companies that have strong organic growth and bolt-on acquisition growth potential. We see exceptional growth opportunities for Vitrek in 2018 and beyond.”\n\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nAbout Branford Castle Partners (http://www.branfordcastle.com/)\n\nLed by John S. Castle and David Castle, Branford Castle is a recently formed lower-middle-market investment fund. Between 1986 and 2016, Branford operated as an award-winning family office. Building from its significant investment successes, Branford recently raised its first fund open to outside investors. With each new investment, Branford builds on its 30+ year history of helping to grow businesses. The firm typically makes control investments in companies with less than $15 million of EBITDA and a leadership position in a niche industry. Branford is particularly keen on the strong relationships it develops with its portfolio company managers.\n\nBranford has particular expertise in consumer products and services, commercial distribution, business services and logistics.

The raised fund will be used to expand the manufacturing capacity and technology applicability and cater to demand from both local and global customers, according to the company statement.\n\nFounded by Debashis Das in 2015, Bharati Robotics aims to accelerate the applications of robotic solutions in cleaning and material handling equipment such as scrubber-driers and sweepers. The company has also been successful in getting tech-giant Intel’s support for technology integration and adaption; and, plans to introduce its products in global market too.\n\nDebashis Das said, ” We believe adoption of robotics will not only increase efficiency across processes in industries but will be restructuring the markets and sectors, and will eventually make the economy more robust creating more quality and well-paying jobs. We are thankful to the respected stakeholders for their soaring faith on us.”\n\nAppreciating Team Bharati’s effort, Pankaj Kumar Singh, Member, Board Of Advisory, Bharati Robotics stated, “The team is small but very well capable of transforming the global perspective of people towards Robotics and are all set to become the key change agent in the Global market in this era of Robotics & Automation.”\n\nRobotic Cleaning: The Current Indian Market Scenario\n\nWhile Bharati Robotics aims to cater to the industrial space as well as malls and housekeeping at hotels, mechanised cleaning in India has been the forte of foreign players like Sealed Air, Karcher, IPC, and Nilfisk. Sealed Air has already acquired the USA’s leading robotics brand Intellibot and has introduced Internet of Clean across a range of cleaning equipment and hygiene products. Nilfisk too has joined hands with Carnegie Robotics to provide nextGen cleaning solutions. Recently, cleaning & hygiene with a market potential of over $150 Bn has attracted many entrepreneurs to start their own startups and provide distinct solutions. Another indigenous cleaning equipment manufacturer Benaka Engineering too has come up with some smart-sensor based cleaning approach. However, except Roots Multiclean and Alano Motors, other indigenous cleaning equipment manufacturers still have a long journey to cover. Bharati Robotics claims to have received numerous enquiries and enrollments from big brands and corporates across India, the US and Europe as well as distribution requests/enquiries from 17 countries across the globe.\n\nSo far limited to manufacturing cleaning and material handling equipment only, Bharati Robotics has plans to introduce their autonomous solutions in other sectors too, such as agriculture, infrastructure and defence. The Pune-based company has already been recognised as a startup by the DIPP, government of India.", "entities": [[0, 4, "headquarters_loc"], [11, 27, "org_in_focus"], [35, 46, "money_funded"], [60, 78, "investor"], [81, 97, "org_in_focus"], [182, 186, "headquarters_loc"], [240, 256, "org_in_focus"], [271, 282, "money_funded"], [331, 374, "investor"], [643, 647, "year_founded"], [649, 665, "org_in_focus"], [3052, 3056, "headquarters_loc"]]}
