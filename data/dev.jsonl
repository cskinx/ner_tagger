{"text": "Matrix Partners And Times Internet Back Online Pharmacy Startup Myra.\n\nBengaluru-based online pharmacy startup Myra has raised an undisclosed amount in extended Series A round of funding from Times Internet and the existing investor Matrix Partners. The deal amount has been speculated to be somewhere around $7Mn – $8 Mn, according to Indiatimes.\n\n“Very few companies in India have been as successful in infusing technology into operations as Myra has. Myra has created a high frequency use case that makes it super easy for users to access a pharmacy digitally. We are delighted to partner with Myra and looking forward to accelerating their growth and expansion.” said Miten Sampat, VP – Corporate Development, Times Internet.\n\nMyra was launched in April 2015 by Faizan Aziz and his friend Anirudh S Coontoor. They both were keen on starting up in the hyperlocal space but had their doubts on how to start and the stickiness of the product. The idea to explore the pharmaceutical vertical germinated when Faizan and his wife fell ill together. The process of getting medicines delivered at home was cumbersome and the delivery time was less than ideal.\n\nThe founders realised how broken this ‘delivery’ process was, in the online pharmacy space.\n\nThe duo decided to operate Myra on a full-stack model (with its own warehouses and a drug license) in partnership with registered pharmacists. Now, after two years of inception, the startup is clocking around 1,000 orders per day with a core team of 20 and an overall team of 300. It also claims to have the fastest delivery time of one hour in this space. Earlier in February 2016, the company had raised an undisclosed amount in Series A funding round from Matrix Partners, Pranay Chulet, co-founder of Quikr, and Prashant Malik, co-founder of LimeRoad.\n\nRelated Article: Medlife Acquires Myra Medicines To Strengthen Epharma Biz\n\nChallenges In Fixing The ‘Broken’ Online Pharmacy Delivery Process\n\nJust like any other startup, the founders of Myra also faced their set of challenges. As Faizan describes, “ Medicine is a very fragmented market and it’s difficult to understand the supply chain. In Karnataka alone, there are more than 1,000 distributors and the product coverage is nearly 1 Lakh. To figure out what to order and how to build up stock at our warehouse was a very big challenge for us.” He further explained, “Unlike FMCG, where they have fast-moving products, in medicine the stock is kept for years. So we really had to figure out how to get this done. This is where technology and data science came to our rescue.”\n\nBy understanding the sales patterns and resulting metrics, the duo got a hold of inventory v/x fulfilment ration – with respect to products, order frequency and more. As claimed by Faizan, today they have 90% fulfilment with 30 days inventory. “And this is very odd in the industry because, usually, it is 60% fulfilment with 60 days inventory.”.\n\nThe other issue they faced was logistics. The delivery was either very expensive or technology needed to be used to reduce the cost. “The technology we use is called Auto Assignment, which allows one manager to handle nearly 100 delivery boys. So everything is automated. So, we are able to do on an average 2 orders per run /per delivery boy and 16-18 deliveries per day for each delivery boy. Usually it is 8-10 in the industry,” Faizan said.\n\nThere are various online medicine retailers following different models. Bengaluru-based online healthcare platform Practo, who recently unveiled a new brand identity, has also added an option on its app that allows users to order medicines. Other startups in this segment include Netmeds.comMerapharmacy.com,, , and Medidart.com that supply prescription-based medicines.\n\nWhen asked how Myra differentiates itself from these players, Faizan states, “I can tell you right now there is no online pharmacy, which has over 20,000 products available in a one-hour range. Everything is tech-driven and that’s how we manage best prices. For instance, one of our warehouses delivers 200 orders per day during peak time and we just have eight people managing it.”\n\nWith the newly raised funds, the company is planning to extend its footprint into two more metro cities. While Mumbai is finalised, the team is still brainstorming on the third possibility. Faizan further stated, “When we started Myra we decided that our main focus should be speed, reliability, convenience, and cost. Today, looking at our strong customer retention, I believe we made the right decision. By focussing on data science, R&D, and engineering we will make our user experience even better, thereby ensuring to solve customer issues more efficiently.”\n\nAccording to an IBEF report, overall the Indian pharma industry is expected to “grow to $55 Bn by 2020, thereby emerging as the sixth largest pharmaceutical market globally by absolute size.” Also, the overall Indian healthcare market is worth around $100 Bn. It is expected to grow to $280 Bn by 2020 at a CAGR of 22.9%.\n\n2016 proven to be a cold winter for the online pharmacy market in India, as the total funding dropped to $97.2 Mn from $302 Mn in 2015, as per Inc42 DataLabs analysis. However, the sector seems to have had a good start with 2017. Earlier this month, Mumbai-based pharma platform PharmEasy raised $16 Mn in Series B round led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Orios Venture Partners. Including this, to date, Q1’17 has already achieved $90 Mn fund raise, signalling positive investor sentiment in the sector.", "entities": [[0, 15, "investor"], [20, 34, "investor"], [64, 68, "org_in_focus"], [71, 80, "headquarters_loc"], [111, 115, "org_in_focus"], [130, 148, "money_funded"], [161, 169, "type_of_funding"], [192, 206, "investor"], [233, 248, "investor"], [309, 321, "money_funded"], [731, 735, "org_in_focus"], [758, 762, "year_founded"]]}

{"text": "Every VC company is a media company.\n\nThe National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and Cambridge Associates recently released a study showing that VC funds returned an average of 7.4% annually over a 10 year period. For early stage funding it was just 6.4%. This compares to 8.5% for the S&P 500.\n\nThe VCs of Silicon Valley have an unshakeable belief in their investment skills, despite the study’s Big Data showing they can’t outperform a grandmother investing in an S&P Index fund.\n\nIt’s easy to see how “smart money” VCs end up with dumb money returns, when they herd into the same types of me-too startups and ruin the market for each other; or force their portfolio companies to pivot their business plans based on the trend du jour in their Twitter streams.\n\nAdd to that, imposing toxic term sheets onto a startup’s founders — and it’s no wonder they are increasingly despised in startup communities on both coasts.\n\nRandom picks\n\nThe VCs are extraordinarily bad at picking winners. It might be better to assign investments to a wide variety of startups on a lottery basis.\n\nI can guarantee there would be far fewer me-too startups funded; and the next big thing is always the ugly duckling no one wanted so you might just get lucky and get that black swan event — an extraordinary return on investment. It certainly won’t happen by following the groupthink of the gulag.\n\nA funding lottery for pre qualified startups could work. Random acts of funding will hit gold some of the time and probably about the same number of times as “smart” funding.\n\nA long line…\n\nThere have always been plenty of people that would love to prick VC egos but lately, their numbers seem to be rising. Others see it too.\n\nR. Scott Raynovich at The Rayno Report writes that, “a quiet attack is building on the VC industry.”\n\n“Entrepreneurs and tech-company executives I have been speaking to lately have turned up their griping about VC investing, pointing out that it’s dysfunctional and overrated.”\n\nRaynovich points out that a small number of VC firms have done well:\n\n“Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Greylock Partners, which was recently profiled in this interesting Bloomberg BusinessWeek article… Greylock was invested in Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Pandora Media (P), Workday (WDAY), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). That seems like more than luck.”\n\nHowever, the lack of data on individual VC funds makes it hard to judge performance; how much luck or brains, separates the cream from the whey.\n\nEvery VC company is a media company…\n\nKeeping up the VC myth of “smart money” is tough when the Big Data shows it’s clearly not. But there are tried and true methods to keep the hot air pumping up the hype using traditional means: PR and media.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz, with more than US$2.7bn under management in three funds, is leading the way. The firm recruited Margit Wennmachers, the co-founder of PR firm OutCast Communications as a partner; and more recently, it hired Michael Copeland, a senior editor at Wired magazine.\n\nSome its partners have made private investments in PandoDaily, the tech news site, and in local media stars such as Michael Arrington and his CrunchFund.\n\nIt’s paid off well. The firm’s founders have been regularly featured in the New York Times and other leading media outlets such as CNN. It’s making other VC firms jealous and I hear that other VC firms are scrambling to do the same and boost their time in the spotlight — rather than their startups.\n\nBecause it is all about the dealflow. Yes, you might turn down the next Google or Facebook –every VC firm has it’s stories — but at least you had the dealflow to turn down. Being constantly in the media is key to getting to see the best of the startups and that means more chances at beating the S&P500.\n\nHiring good journalists could be a good strategy for VC firms to differentiate themselves from the herd but I doubt it will work. The journalists will be simple employees at the beck and call of masters that always know better.\n\nInside the mirrored bubble their reflection looks so very good — which is why we need an independent media — to point out any distorted fantasies. It’s good for all.\n\nAnd there’s no point in hiring journalists to produce puff pieces about the “Princes of Sand Hill Road” when there’s plenty of PR people expert in kissing frogs.\n\nThis article by Tom Foremski originally appeared on Silicon Valley Watcher, a Burn Media publishing partner", "entities": []}

With Integrity, the Litmus platform will provide clinicians with assurance that emitted data, transmitted data, ingested data and acted-upon data are the same.\n\n“Sixgill Integrity protects against the demonstrated reality that digital systems security is an illusion. Data, however, is defensible,” says Phil Ressler, CEO of Sixgill, LLC. “Healthcare industry data is especially personal, vulnerable and regulated. The goal of our exciting work with Litmus Health is to deliver unparalleled security, transparency and immutability necessary to validate, secure and defend painstakingly gathered and rigorously audited clinical data.”\n\nThrough the Sixgill-Litmus partnership, clinicians will reliably comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11 regulations when conducting clinical trials.\n\nPart 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations establishes the United States Food and Drug Administration regulations on electronic records. Part 11 defines the criteria for electronic records and electronic signatures to be considered trustworthy, reliable and equivalent to paper records. Litmus customers using electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) data and data from wearables, smart devices and home sensors will benefit from new ways to save time and lower costs, such as:\n\nEfficiency of having one, consistent source of data quality and assurance\n\nPermanent, regulatory-grade auditability, traceability and certainty\n\nStreamlined quality and process automation\n\nA breakthrough hybrid on-chain/off-chain approach to blockchain-enabled integrity that protects privacy and enables real-time performance at scale\n\nImproved data security with tamper-proof, auditable logs of time-series data and near-real-time notification of changes\n\n“We know how pressing concerns of data accuracy and consistency are to our customers, which is why the Litmus platform has always offered a stack that emphasizes traceability and transparency within clinical trial data streams. With the implementation of Sixgill Integrity, we’re pleased to offer clinicians and researchers continuous auditability of their clinical data chain,” says Daphne Kis, CEO of Litmus Health. “This collaboration with Sixgill will accelerate the adoption and integration of novel endpoints by researchers while strengthening the integrity of data captured during clinical trials and observational studies.”\n\nThrough this new collaboration, Sixgill seeks to prove that live, trustless audit immutability is feasible for any data system, and Litmus seeks to prove that federally regulated healthcare data projects can meet or exceed data authenticity mandates.\n\nThe combined data aggregation, analysis and integrity solution for clinical trials will be fully tested and generally available in Q1 2019.\n\nAbout Sixgill\n\nSixgill builds universal sensor data automation services that enable organizations to govern IoE assets. Sixgill Sense™ offers developers the ability to easily acquire, analyze and act on any sensor-generated data, at any velocity or scale. Sense offers customers a single powerful platform to unify sensor data management, process automation and analytics for all sensor-informed applications.

{"text": "STALICLA Announces Completion of pre-IND Meeting With FDA on STP1 for Subgroup of Patients With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).\n\nSTP1 is a pioneering investigational precision medicine that aims to provide an effective treatment option for a subgroup of patients with ASD (referred to as ‘Phenotype 1’). Phenotype 1 is estimated to include 20% of the total ASD population (2 million out of 10 million patients with ASD across Europe and North America), meaning STP1 has the potential to be a ‘game-changing’ influence in the field.\n\nGENEVA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–August 23, 2019–\n\nSTALICLA, a Swiss Biotech company, today announced the completion of its pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the preparation for entry of STP1 into clinical trials.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190822005559/en/\n\nSTALICLA at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss its investigational precision medicine for Autism Spectrum Disorder (Photo: STALICLA)\n\n“We are appreciative of FDA´s technical guidance and strong interest in personalized medicine approaches for patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder. STALICLA is committed to rapidly move forward with the submission of its STP1 IND. STP1 holds the potential to become the first precision medicine for a subgroup of patients with ASD, and herald a new age for this field.”\n\n– Lynn Durham, CEO and Founder of STALICLA.\n\nASD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, with high level of heterogeneity, that affects 1 in 59 8-year-old school children in the U.S. (CDC, 2018). Eighty percent of patients are still considered idiopathic (without a genetically identifiable cause). Traditionally, drug developers have approached ASD as a single-disease entity, overlooking its clinical complexity and biological heterogeneity.\n\nSTP1 has been developed using STALICLA´s innovative systems biology-driven platform (DEPI), which is an integrative framework that uses large-scale genetic, molecular, pharmacological and clinical data to define patient subgroups in ASD and to identify personalized treatments.\n\nThis is the first time that such technologies have been utilized within the field of neurodevelopment, and it is a hugely exciting project with scope to change the direction of this speciality.\n\nSTALICLA will submit its STP1 IND to enter a Phase 1b clinical trial. The First ‘Phenotype 1’ ASD patients will be enrolled in early 2020.\n\nAbout STALICLA\n\nSTALICLA is a near clinical Swiss Biotech Company developing a unique approach to bring personalized medicine to patients with ASD. Today, patients with ASD account for approximately 1.5% of the world’s population, and the condition remains a high unmet medical need.\n\nIn its Geneva and Barcelona units, STALICLA has assembled world-class teams of experienced drug developers and computational biologists. The Company is recognized as a disruptive player, using its systems biology DEPI platform to identify subgroups of patients with ASD and candidate repurposed and rescued drugs. Patients are then characterized through biomarker preclinical and clinical investigations. This translates into a derisked drug development process bringing the vision of ASD personalized medicine to reality.\n\nSTALICLA’s first investigational precision medicine – STP1 – addresses a distinct subgroup of ASD patients estimated to 2 million people in Europe and North America. To support STP1’s development and create strong value for all stakeholders, STALICLA has developed a network of top-tier research and clinical partners and established IP as a strategic priority. STALICLA is currently applying its DEPI discovery model to characterize additional subgroups of patients and advance new pipelines. Applicability of the DEPI platform goes beyond ASD and has potential for drug discovery in other complex ill-defined diseases.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190822005559/en/\n\nLynn Durham\n\ncommunication@stalicla.com\n\n0041 (0) 22 545 12 42", "entities": []}

Even before that the company had increased its community by over 150 percent in less than a year, to 2.5 million photographers. It now gets over a billion page views and API request per monthacross the platform.\n\nToday the company has brought on a few “tech heavy hitters” as executives. Andy Yang joins as their new COO, formerly the managing director of Extreme Startups. Meanwhile Patrick Lor comes on as a new board member. Lor formerly cofounded iStock Photo, the company that exited for $50 million nearly a decade ago.\n\nYang, previously of Netflix, Chegg, Goldman Sachs and Accenture, made a big dent in the Canadian startup world through his work at Extreme Startups. There the former managing director oversaw three successful cohorts of startups, including such names as Shoplocket, Picatic, Instaradio and Koge Vitamins.\n\n“Andy brings a depth of strategic and business management expertise to 500px,” read a release. “He’ll be overseeing company’s operations, financial direction, and growth and strengthening organizational policies and processes.”\n\nMeanwhile Lor is well known for cofounding the immensely popular iStock Photo, which was acquired by Getty Images in 2004. After that Lor moved on to start Dissolve, a stock footage company that helps brands tell better stories with video. As a director Lor will help with the commercial licensing marketplace that 500px is expected to roll out in the New Year.\n\nLor had some nice things to say about the startup that he is now helping. “500px is one of the most beautiful sites on the Internet,” he said. “People spend hours browsing amazing images and soaking in the creative inspiration from the community. Evgeny and Oleg and their team have an opportunity to disrupt the commercial photo space and help photographers earn a lot more money from their work. I’m excited to help 500px execute on this goal.”\n\nIn “Evgeny”, Lor is referring to founder Evgeny Tchebotarev, who moves on to the role of chief product officer. “He will supervise the product teams as they innovate and improve current offerings and create new products that add value for photographers.”\n\nFinally Renat Gataullin, one of the early partners in the company, rejoins as CTO. A serial entrepreneur, Gataullin recently graduated from the prestigious Y Combinator Accelerator program in Silicon Valley. As CTO, he’ll map the platform’s development and ensuring its ability to quickly scale amid expansion.\n\nCofounder Oleg Gutsol said that “big ideas demand big thinkers”. “We’ve assembled a team of bright, innovative leaders who will help us push the boundaries of 500px as we work to achieve our goal of being the best photographer-centred platform in the world.”\n\n500px has been so impressive mainly because the company hardly tried to monetize before it meteoric rise and subsequent huge series A round. The photo licensing space has long been an industry with a fairly straightforward business model and a straight path to make money.\n\nFounded in 2009, the company “has grown to become the premier platform with the highest quality photography worldwide.”", "entities": []}

{"text": "Business Angel Network HBAN aims to attract new members and plans to raise €6m in a 48 hour roadshow.\n\nThe Halo Business Angel Network (HBAN) has announced its plans to raise new funds of €6 million in the space of just 48 hours. The campaign is going to start on Wednesday 9th November in Dublin. The organisation will also visit Cork, Waterford and Galway. Its representatives are going to speak to potential new business angels looking to invest in some of Ireland’s most promising startups.\n\nHBAN is a joint initiative of InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, dedicated to the all-island promotion of business angel investment. The HBAN umbrella group supports the early stage entrepreneurial community across the island of Ireland and actively works to increase the number of angel investors investing in early stage companies. The all-island umbrella group works on a regional basis to support the formation of new angel networks and works with existing angel networks to develop their capability and capacity, and across a range of industry sectors. Fora – medium for Ireland’s startup and SME community – calculated that HBAN helped raise funding rounds of around €27 million in year 2015. €10.8 million came from direct angel investments in 50 companies, while the rest was sourced from a mix of public and private funds.\n\nThe roadshow is going to be available for pre-registered members of the public and potential angels. HBAN is going to share information on what is required to become a successful business angel investor. It will also provide the opportunity for prospective angels to network with HBAN’s existing angels. Business angels are typically successful entrepreneurs from the industry who invest in early stage companies and contribute their knowledge and contacts to help them grow. They provide finance in amounts typically ranging from € 50,000 to € 250,000.\n\nJohn Phelan, HBAN National Director stated: “The Business Angel Roadshow gives us a chance to show potential investors the value of angel investing and the quality of deal flow that HBAN provides to the network. There are thousands of early-stage companies in Ireland looking not just for funding, but also the right expertise to help them scale. We have seen ourselves how valuable angel investing is to companies and now we need more angels to invest in Ireland’s promising start-ups and our economic future.”\n\nHBAN hopes that an additional 27 investors with combined funds of approximately € 6 million – up from € 3 million last year – will sign up to become members of the HBAN Business Angel Network at the recruitment drive. The organisation aims to sign up 10 angels in Dublin, seven in Cork and five each in Waterford and Galway. Industry expertise of interest includes IT, telecommunications, food and beverages, digital marketing, medtech, agritech and nutraceuticals.\n\nThe roadshow will also give 12 start-ups the chance to pitch to current business angels, as well as angel syndicates, for their investment and expertise. Combined, the companies are seeking more than € 10 million in funding. Many Irish start-ups are attracted to business angel investment because it provides them not just with much-needed capital, but also the expertise, domain knowledge and network of contacts that each angel brings to the table. This strategic support can help companies grow and ultimately, scale.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Investors use loophole in VC tax incentive to invest in own companies.\n\nInvestors are using a loophole in a SA venture capital (VC) tax incentive to invest in companies connected to them and benefit from a whopping 125% write-off on their taxable income, the SA Revenue Services (Sars) revealed yesterday.\n\nThe incentive, which falls under Section 12J of the Income Tax Act and came into effect in 2009, entitles investors that invest in accredited VC companies that then invest in small businesses, to make a tax deduction of 125% in the year that the investment was made.\n\nLast week saw an outcry from South Africa’s venture capital (VC) and private equity sector over amendments the National Treasury plans to make to the incentive in an effort to close the door on abuse of the incentive by investors.\n\nA key amendment is that The National Treasury wants to allow only one class of shares in VC companies themselves and the “qualifying” companies that they invest in. The proposals also call for a ban on trading between the investor in the VC company and the targeted qualifying company.\n\nThe SA Revenue Service (Sars) told Ventureburn in response to a media query yesterday that investors are using different class shares to get around the incentives connected person rule — one of the anti-avoidance measures contained in the Income Tax Act which governs the incentive.\n\nInvestors are using a loophole in the 12J VC tax incentive to invest in companies connected to them and benefit from a 125% write-off on their taxable income\n\nAn investor must not be a connected party to the VCC or to the qualifying company which receives the investment.\n\n“This is to ensure that investors, who have capital and companies, do not use such capital for the benefit of their companies and get a tax deduction — which would otherwise not have been available,” said Sars.\n\nSars said there is a “general trend” to investors using the authorisation of different share classes by approved VCCs to circumvent the connected party rules.\n\n“Through such share classes, an investor who owns an underlying qualifying company receives a ‘capital injection’ in that qualifying company while simultaneously receiving a tax deduction in his or her personal capacity for the amount invested in the approved VCC,” said Sars.\n\n‘Sars yet to specify abuse’\n\nSars’ response comes as last week the body that represents the industry — the Southern African Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (Savca) — claimed it doesn’t know what abuse Sars is referring to.\n\nIn response to a Ventureburn request for comment last week, Savca head of regulatory affairs Shelley Lotz said Sars and the National Treasury have “yet to specify the abuse they’ve identified”.\n\n“Savca is aware that they (Sars) are aware of abusive structures relating to putting luxury homes and capital expenditure through VCCs. This, however, hasn’t been explicitly stated by either Sars or the National Treasury,” she said.\n\n‘Multiple share classes is global practice’\n\nCommenting on the National Treasury’s plan to do away with different share classes, Lotz said while this may help curb some tax abuse it has also caught in its net strictly commercial applications of different share classes.\n\nMost fund managers she pointed out, use multiple share classes to allocate performance incentives to the fund manager and to raise different tranches of capital.\n\nPerhaps the greatest problem, said Savca, is that global best practice in venture capital investing requires different share classes at the investee level for different rounds of capital raised, as these have different pricing with different rights attached.\n\n“These are strictly commercial applications with no tax considerations applied and we have provided extensive evidence to this effect in our submission,” she said.\n\nLotz said the organisation, along with a credible research partner, will be undertaking a survey of all VCCs to gather information on the economic impact of the investment incentive for the benefit of National Treasury.\n\nSavca declined to share with Ventureburn the submission it made to Parliament’s finance standing committee last week as part of the public participation process.\n\nRead more: State must close door on those that misuse VC tax incentive [Opinion]\n\nRead more: Savca raises concern over governance issues in Section 12J VC tax incentive\n\nRead more: Venture capitalists welcome Section 12J proposals but call for more changes\n\nRead more: Capital flight talk over says Grovest man on launch of R200m Metta Capital fund\n\nRead more: Can 12J VC tax incentive create the jobs South Africa badly needs?\n\nRead more: Investors clamouring for 12J VC incentive following tax hike – fund managers\n\nRead more: Foreign investment injection could propel South Africa’s VC ecosystem, 12J funds\n\nFeatured image: stevepb via Pixabay (CC0 Creative Commons)", "entities": []}
{"text": "After Flipkart, SoftBank Eyes Stake In Paytm Mall At $2 Bn Valuation.\n\nPaytm Mall Is Said To Be In Talks To Raise $600 Mn From SoftBank, Temasek And Others\n\nThe recently released Inc42 DataLabs Funding Report 2017 quoted the last year as the ‘era of SoftBank India invasion’. With empires like Flipkart, Ola, OYO, Swiggy, Paytm under its control, SoftBank is now eyeing to invade Alibaba’s ecommerce fort, Paytm Mall. Reportedly, Paytm Mall is in talks with SoftBank to raise $600 Mn at a valuation of $2 Bn.\n\nPrimavera Capital Group, a China-based investment firm focusing on private equity and special situations opportunities, as well as Singapore state investment arm Temasek Holdings are also expected to participate in this funding round.\n\nAs per the media report, the earlier fund infusion in Paytm Mall came internally from SAIF Partners, Alibaba, and Ant Financial. “Because of this, the valuation of the company was never clear. The latest funding from SoftBank and others will clearly put Paytm Mall in the unicorn bracket,” added a Business standard source.\n\nAn email sent to Paytm Mall did not elicit any response till the time of publication.\n\nSoftBank: Major Bets In India\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate started its India invasion in 2011, betting $200 Mn on the tech company InMobi. Fast forward to 2014, SoftBank shifted its focus to India’s rising consumer internet segment for the next few years, placing its eyes on sectors such as ecommerce, budget hotel providers as well as online grocery, thereby raking in significant stakes in startups such as Snapdeal, OYO and Ola respectively.\n\nHowever, as 2016-17 called for market correction, prompting even the established players like Snapdeal, Flipkart, Grofers, Zomato to look for a substantial base to survive, the majority of SoftBank’s investments in India got tangled in the web of losses.\n\nIt was the end of 2016 when Masayoshi Son led SoftBank started taking command and pitched in for consolidating losses in its Indian investments. While the Snapdeal-Flipkart merger fiasco hit the Japanese conglomerate hard, it did not stop Son from making further bets in the Indian ecosystem through its $100 Bn Vision Fund.\n\nBetween April-December 2017 alone, SoftBank has already invested over $5 Bn (almost equivalent to Amazon’s five-year investment target in India) to acquire significant stakes in a few of the major companies in the Indian consumer internet segment. This includes\n\nFurther, as reported earlier by Inc42, SoftBank is also said to be in talks with new/existing portfolio companies for the follow-on funding as well as stake buyout rounds. This includes Grofers ($65 Mn funding at a 40% lower valuation), Swiggy ($250 Mn funding), PolicyBazaar (major stake acquisition at a valuation of $800 Mn), Flipkart (buyout of shares at $10 Bn valuation) amongst other speculations.\n\nThe results of this aggressive spending are evident too. Just last month, SoftBank posted gains of $74 Mn (JPY 8,069 Mn) on account of the gain on investments made in companies in Southeast Asia and India in the nine-month period ending in December 2017. The gain is in contrast to the loss of $360 Mn (JPY 39,281 Mn) that it incurred during the corresponding period ending December 2016.\n\nThe bet on Paytm Mall might help SoftBank reap more profits, as the company is gearing to take on Amazon with its e-grocery division. As per recent reports, Paytm also plans to invest up to $2.5 Bn to grow its nascent online shopping portal business within three to five years as it eyes the top spot currently being fought over by Flipkart and Amazon.\n\nWith SoftBank trying to acquire stakes in the Indian unicorns at an aggressive pace, it’s time for the Indian startup ecosystem to fasten its seat belt and get ready for some serious action. As far as the funding in Paytm Mall is concerned, if the deal goes through, the ambitions of Vijay Shekhar Sharma will certainly get wings to fly high in the sky.\n\n[The development was reported by Business Standard.]", "entities": [[2711, 2723, "org_in_focus"], [2807, 2813, "money_funded"]]}

{"text": "Aspiring entrepreneurs in the UK: Here’s what it takes to make it?.\n\nThere are many preconceptions about the qualities needed to make a successful entrepreneur. You’ve got to have the creativity to come up with something different, and the confidence to do it alone – not to mention the drive and discipline to take your idea and grow it into a business.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nBut beyond that, is there more to success than simply being creative, confident and hard-working? We asked a group of people who successfully built their own businesses what they thought was really needed in order to make it as an entrepreneur.\n\nEducation\n\nAlmost 8 in 10 entrepreneurs (79%) said they felt that the UK education system does not provide young people with the relevant skills required to start their own business.\n\nSo which skills would be the most valuable to better-equip young people for self-employment? Among the most popular suggestions from our survey were “a better understanding of financing” (chosen by 89%) of respondents, followed by “better understanding of economics” (74%) and “management skills” (64%).\n\nIf you’re a business owner with most of your growth ahead of you, one place you may want to go to finance your expansion, and learn how to manage it, is back to school. However, this doesn’t mean you have to immediately sign up to an MBA – there are a myriad of options to suit all budgets and lifestyles. Business Development Centres and Business Schools offer a variety of drop in classes as well as course options, so you can brush up on whatever skills you need at your convenience.\n\nFunding\n\nOnce you have decided on the type of venture you want to start, the next step on the road to business success is figuring out where the money will come from to finance it. But while securing funding may seem like it could make or break the foundation of your business, it may not take as much as you think to get the ball rolling.\n\nIn fact, our survey found that just 5% of entrepreneurs took out a bank loan to fund their business when they started out. Instead, over half (52%) of entrepreneurs surveyed said they had funded their business from personal savings – with almost a quarter (23%) saying it cost them less than £250 to start their business.\n\nInterestingly, over half (57%) of those surveyed said that they don’t think banks do enough to support small businesses, which may explain the preference for self funding. Another factor is that small business lending took a hit during the 2008 recession, and seemingly hasn’t recovered since.\n\nBanks typically prefer funding large business loans to small business loans since the latter accrue fewer profits than the former. Usually, small businesses are seeking small business loans, and therefore their requests are often declined since it does not make financial sense for a bank to process a small loan.\n\nLack of collateral can also be an issue for small businesses applying for funding. Most banks usually require collateral to give out a loan which acts as a guarantee that the loan will be repaid. The amount that the banks will lend often depends on the value of the collateral. This then becomes a major challenge for small businesses, which may have no valuable asset to offer.\n\nWhile some major banks have already started to experiment with loans specifically intended for small business – such as NatWest and RapidCash – it will be interesting to see how they continue to adapt in the face of fintech challengers in the future.\n\nInspiration\n\nEveryone could use a little advice once in a while, so we asked our entrepreneurs who they would choose as a business mentor. We received a wide range of suggestions from multinational giants through to TV Dragons and political leaders, but the most popular choice was Sir Richard Branson, followed by Sir Alan Sugar and Steve Jobs.\n\nAll three of these entrepreneurs are, of course, wildly successful, but they had to start somewhere! It’s their ambition and drive that has not only sustained their success throughout their careers, but that has made them into role models for entrepreneurs the world over.\n\nIt’s also no coincidence that they all showed great adaptability and resilience throughout their careers – whether by taking risks to diversify their business streams (Branson), reinventing their personal brand (Sugar) or putting their faith in new innovations (Jobs). That’s a key lesson for today’s entrepreneurs to learn from if they aspire to the same level of success.\n\nGuest post by Ed Molyneux, CEO and co-founder of FreeAgent, who makes award-winning cloud accounting software for freelancers, small businesses and accountants.\n\nMain image credits: Stock Photos from Halfpoint/Shutterstock\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more European technology news.", "entities": []}

Banks and enterprises recognize receivables management has to address the 50 percent of B2B payments that are still handled through paper checks while positioning themselves for changes in payment and remittance processes across the globe. HighRadius has an 11-year track record of solving these problems for the world's largest companies. Embracing the changing payments landscape, Citi Ventures and PNC have invested in HighRadius' vision to fundamentally redefine the future of the B2B payments landscape.\n\n\n\nAs an industry leader, HighRadius sits at the nexus of several key trends in financial technology: enabling near real-time payments, artificial intelligence and cloud delivery. By developing software that incorporates these capabilities, operational silos in payment processing are dissolved and tasks that previously required experienced human judgement - further complicated by complex IT deployments - are automatically resolved.

HighRadius' platform is purpose-built to modernize the accounts receivable function for the enterprise,\" said Luis Valdich, managing director of venture investing at Citi Ventures. \"We look forward to collaborating with HighRadius to revamp receivables with AI and automation technologies.\"\n\n\n\n\"PNC Treasury Management has a long history of helping customers accelerate incoming payment processing while simplifying the account process through a combination of lockbox and electronic billing and collection services,\" said Christopher Ward, Executive Vice President, Head of Product Management, PNC Treasury Management. \"With HighRadius' receivables-focused technology, we are able to automate cash application across all payment and remittance formats allowing them to achieve straight-through processing and capture high quality data without human intervention.\"\n\n\n\n\"If cars can drive themselves, why can't receivables be processed automatically?\" asks Sashi Narahari, Founder and CEO of HighRadius. \"Progressive organizations recognize they must look for new ways to incorporate technology rather than simply overseeing a race to the lowest cost resources in far flung BPO centers. With more than $500 billion in receivables processed annually, our platform improves the efficiency of existing staff using intelligent bots while fully automating labor-intensive tasks such as cash application.\"\n\n\n\nAbout Citi Ventures\n\n\n\nCiti Ventures ignites change and reimagines solutions that drive economic progress for clients.

In October of last year he donated $1 million to launch the Laurier Start-up Fund, a new program designed to teach Wilfrid Laurier University business students how to make decisions about investing in startups.

CanSinoBIO maintains the option to support commercial manufacturing for Ocugen. The agreement also provides commercialization rights to CanSinoBIO in Greater China.\n\n“We believe our modifier gene therapy platform, and OCU400 as its first product candidate, has the potential to treat many inherited retinal diseases with one product,” said Shankar Musunuri, Ph.D., MBA, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Ocugen. “A reliable manufacturing partnership is critical for gene therapy clinical trials and commercialization. Partnership with CanSinoBIO, with their state-of-the-art facilities and world class team, provides us a clear path to advance our development and manufacturing processes to reach the clinic.”\n\nOCU400 has received two different orphan drug designations (ODD) from the U.S. FDA. The first, for the treatment of NR3E3 mutation-associated retinal degeneration and, most recently, for the treatment of CEP290 mutation-associated retinal disease.\n\n“We are delighted to partner with Ocugen as they advance their portfolio of AAV-based gene therapies for rare retinal diseases”, said Dr. Xuefeng Yu, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CanSinoBIO. “Our expertise in viral vector platform technologies, product development and manufacturing capabilities will play critical roles to advance OCU400 to the clinic and ultimately to serve patients in desperate need for retinal disease therapies.”\n\nAbout OCU400\n\nOCU400 is a novel gene therapy with the potential to be broadly effective in restoring retinal integrity and function across a range of genetically diverse inherited degenerative retinal diseases. OCU400 is the first program that Ocugen is advancing based on its novel modifier gene therapy platform, developed by Neena Haider, PhD, Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and Associate Scientist at the Schepens Eye Research Institute of Massachusetts Eye and Ear, from which Ocugen obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize ophthalmology products based on the platform. Consisting of a functional copy of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) gene NR2E3, OCU400 is delivered to target cells in the retina using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector. As a potent modifier gene, expression of NR2E3 within the retina may help reset retinal homeostasis, stabilizing cells and potentially rescuing photoreceptors from degeneration.\n\nAbout Ocugen, Inc.\n\nOcugen, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing a pipeline of innovative therapies that address rare and underserved eye diseases. The Company offers a robust and diversified ophthalmology portfolio that includes novel gene therapies, biologics, and small molecules and targets a broad range of high-need retinal and ocular surface diseases. Ocugen is leveraging its groundbreaking modifier gene therapy platform to address genetically diverse inherited retinal disorders and dry AMD, based on nuclear hormone receptor genes NR2E3 (OCU400) and RORA (OCU410), respectively. OCU400 has received two orphan drug designations (ODD) targeting two distinct IRDs. Ocugen is also developing novel biologic therapies for wet-AMD, DME and diabetic retinopathy (OCU200), as well as for retinitis pigmentosa (OCU100). The Company’s late-stage Phase 3 trial for patients with ocular graft versus host disease (oGVHD)(OCU300) leverages Ocugen’s patented OcuNanoE – Ocugen’s ONE Platform™ technology to enhance the efficacy of topical ophthalmic therapeutics. OCU300 is the first and only therapeutic with ODD for oGVHD, providing certain regulatory and economic benefits.

{"text": "Got R9200? Why not invest it in SA’s first vertical business jet.\n\nAn SA company, Pegasus Universal Aviation, is looking to raise R20-million from private investors to build a full-scale model of what it claims will be the world’s first true business jet coupled with helicopter convenience. But will it come off?\n\nThe company says the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) Pegasus vertical business jet will have the capabilities of a helicopter and some military capabilities, but will be faster and be able to land practically anywhere, even on grass.\n\nThe jet is expected to have up to eight seats, with a range of 4400km with a runway takeoff and 2124km with VTOL flights. While VTOL jets are being developed as air taxis by Uber among others, the Pegasus jet will be one of the first long-range VTOL business jets once it’s completed.\n\nPrivate investors can purchase shares for the jet at R2300 a share — through the company’s website, by making payments to the company’s Investec bank account. To take part investors must procure a minimum of four shares, totalling R9200.\n\nSo far Pegasus Universal Aviation has raised R3m from about 40 investors against its R20m target\n\nThe offer opened on 23 September and closes on 22 December.\n\nSo far the company has raised just R3-million, from about 40 investors, the company’s COO Nasrin Ebrahim told Ventureburn.\n\nShe confirmed that the company’s prospectus (opens as a PDF) doesn’t demand that the company’s raise must reach a certain minimum threshold or the money will be returned to investors (as is common in some crowdfunding campaigns).\n\n‘High risk investment’\n\nThe prospectus opens with a cautionary note to those looking to invest, that the shares on offer are unlisted “and should be considered a risk-capital investment”.\n\nThe directors are listed in the prospectus as the founder Dr Reza Mia (pictured above), Eminence Partners fund manager Zaakir Hoosein Mia (Reza’s brother) and Ebrahim.\n\nReza Mia, a medical practitioner in the field of aesthetic medicine, founded Pegasus in 2012. The company has a patent on the jet granted in South Africa in 2018 and has patents pending in the US and EU.\n\nMia’s team include former ExecuJet Aviation Group sales manager Robbie Irons, who began working as CEO in April and a former Airbus and Boeing engineer, Matthew Buttle as chief engineer.\n\nThe company is aiming to sell the jet to politicians, business executives and celebrities and VIP’s, as well as to those that want to deploy it for medical evacuation, anti-poaching and offshore and resource development.\n\nR88.8bn in sales forecast\n\nGoing on figures provided in the prospectus, each jet will sell at R20-million with the company estimating that it will be able to sell 4444 airplanes over a 15-year period, resulting in R88.8-billion in sales — much of this generated from sales in the Middle East and the US.\n\nMia told Ventureburn that the company settled on the “4444” figure because it wanted to list the “exact number” for investors, adding that the calculation was made using a “25-page Excel document”.\n\nThe company expects the aircraft to be ready for certification and deliveries in five to seven years’ time and estimates that it will cost about $500-million (R7.4-billion) to bring the aircraft to market.\n\nR2.6m raised in 2018\n\nThe latest investment raise follows a R2.6-million raise the company made last year. But Mia didn’t want to disclose to Ventureburn what the target was in that raise. He said only that the company needed to reach at least R2-million to ensure that it could accept the raise from investors.\n\nHe added that he’s spent about R5-million to R10-million of his own money, most of it off his medical practice, in funding the project so far. Most of this money has gone to engineering and marketing costs.\n\nHe says the company did approach the Department of Science and Technology’s Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) for help funding the aircraft, but was told that the project was at too early a stage for the agency to get involved in. For TIA to fund the project, Pegasus at least needed a working model, he says.\n\nMia, a serial entrepreneur, says he hit on the idea of manufacturing an aircraft because of what he refers to as the lucrative profits that can be made from the sector.\n\nSimilar high profits can be made from ship building and property, but Mia reckons that ships “are boring”and the property market is “always going up and down”. So, aircraft it was then.\n\nSome might say the project won’t work because Mia practices as a doctor full time.\n\n“We can’t limit ourselves. I sometimes say if I wasn’t a doctor, would it work out better,” he added.\n\nHe adds that he has a team of about 25 people — including his own staff and contracted engineers from about four or five companies, working on the project.\n\n“So, the project does get enough attention,” he stresses.\n\n‘I’m a genius’\n\nBut will it come off?\n\nThe prototype model is expected to take between 12 to 14 months to complete. Once completed the uncertified and unmanned model will be used to demonstrate the jet’s VTOL capabilities to investors.\n\nWhen questioned on which US company Pegasus had chosen to build its prototype model, Ebrahim revealed to Ventureburn the company had not finalised what subcontractor it would go with.\n\nSo far, three or four subcontractors have sent quotes to Pegasus, but the company has yet to choose which one to go with, she said.\n\nMia added that despite this, he expects construction on the model to start in December, as soon as the raise is over, or in January. It might not necessarily be done by any US company, he added.\n\n“We may do it (the construction of the prototype) ourselves. It will just be a different construction,” says Mia.\n\nAnd what of the naysayers who don’t believe the project will come off?\n\nSays Mia: “I’m a doctor, I have an MBA, I’m a member of Mensa. I’m a genius. So, if I’ve spent seven years investigating this, you must legitimately look into it.”\n\nFeatured image: Pegasus Universal Aviation founder Dr Reza Mia (Facebook)", "entities": []}

Ltd. during the period between October and November 2017, as shown in the filings with the Registrar.\n\nThe investment was made in multiple tranches through Singapore-based group company Klick2Shop Logistics Services International Pte. The transaction was done by allocating equity shares at INR 52.51 per share.\n\nAccording to the filings, Klick2Shop infused $50.8 Mn (INR 3.23 Bn) on October 9, 2017, and topped it up with two more rounds in November. This included an investment of another $50.8 Mn (INR 3.23 Bn) on November 7, 2017, and $154 Mn (INR 9.81 Bn) on November 27, 2017.\n\nPrior to that, the August 2017 filings also revealed an allocation of $460 Mn (INR 3000 Cr) to Ekart for the investment deals. The filing stated, “Considering the future requirements of the company whereby it may have to make strategic investments in other business/acquire companies for inorganic growth, extend loans and/ or guarantee to other corporates or provide security in connection with loans availed by other corporate, it is proposed to fix the limits at $460 Mn (INR 3, 000 Cr).”\n\nAlso, in September 2017, Flipkart invested $147 Mn (INR 961.4 Cr) in two tranches in Ekart via Klick2Shop.\n\nAn email sent to Flipkart did not elicit any response till the time of publication.\n\nSince Flipkart raised the massive $4 Bn funding round, the ecommerce major has been continuously strengthening its logistics roots. Along with Ekart, the company is also making significant efforts to expand its warehousing space.\n\nThe company is currently tangled in a tug war with players like Paytm Mall and Amazon, both of which are spreading their wings in the Indian ecommerce space with heavy war chests. Also, in the coming years, logistics will form the backbone for Flipkart’s ambitious plans to launch grocery delivery operations and a one stop hyperlocal app to cater all needs of the Indian consumer.\n\nThe investment into Ekart also seems to be in line with CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy’s 2018 plans of increasing the monthly active consumers from the existing 10 Mn to 80 Mn in the coming years. Additionally, Flipkart is targeting alliances with platforms in different verticals this year to expand its horizon of services such as Zomato, Swiggy, BookMyShow and more.\n\nThus, allocating funds to Ekart for acquiring other companies or investing in its operations will certainly help Flipkart in ramping up its logistics services for each and every vertical it is targeting. We can also expect Flipkart to open new fulfillment centers in line with the rival Amazon India to penetrate deeper into the tier II and tier III cities in the year 2018.", "entities": [[15, 23, "investor"], [32, 39, "money_funded"], [57, 62, "org_in_focus"], [81, 89, "investor"], [110, 117, "money_funded"], [146, 151, "org_in_focus"], [165, 193, "org_in_focus"]]}

{"text": "Berlin-based automotive AI startup Teraki raises €2 million and launches DevCenter for customers.\n\nBerlin-based automotive AI startup Teraki has developed a platform that promises to bring a more than tenfold increase in efficiency to components used in automotive electronics, a €350 billion industry. Founded in 2014, the startup has now raised €2 million from Hong Kong-based Horizon Ventures and American Family Ventures, bringing its total funding to €4.7 million.\n\nTeraki’s software allows for the scaling of insurance, predictive maintenance, and autonomous driving applications by providing access to more qualitative data. When embedded in automotive electronic systems, the software enables hardware to process more than 10 times more data – without loss of information to train – and run machine learning methods of its customers.\n\nBy applying techniques originally developed for quantum computing, Teraki is able to condense data to as little as two percent of its original size. This means that with Teraki pre-processing, applications run more than 10 times faster than implementations based on neural networks. With respect to sensor fusion, Teraki drastically reduces energy consumption and heat production due to lower computational tasks, while still delivering the algorithm detection and prediction performance that are essential for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.\n\n“Data driven insights will be key to innovation in the automotive and automotive insurance sectors, as a result, capturing highly accurate information from cars is the basis needed to drive to these insights,” said Katelyn Johnson, principal at American Family Ventures. “Teraki aids in acquiring this information with the highest efficiency and accuracy rates. We are excited to support the growth of the company and its path towards enabling better insurance applications.”\n\n“Winning the support of these renowned and leading VCs is further validation of our vision to truly enable efficient edge computing and scalable AI applications in the automotive markets,” said Daniel Richart, Teraki’s CEO and co-founder. “With this investment we will be able to accelerate the time to market for our signed customer contracts and serve the growing customer funnel.”\n\nThe company has also announced the launch of its Teraki DevCenter—a cloud-based data training and prototyping environment that allows customers to train Teraki’s algorithms on their data. Data training is an essential step used to teach AI models or machine learning algorithms how to make data-driven predictions or decisions by building a mathematical model from input data.\n\nUnique to the industry, the DevCenter automates this complex process and provides development teams with the opportunity to quickly train Teraki’s machine learning algorithms based on their own data and to evaluate exactly what performance advantages Teraki’s technology can provide.\n\n“With the DevCenter we have automated data training tasks, allowing development teams to test our solution with their own data more quickly,” said Markus Kopf, Teraki’s co-founder and CTO. “Automating this entire process is complex and difficult. For our current and future customers, this makes it much easier to experience for themselves what Teraki technology can do in terms of edge processing and performance improvements that can lower their hardware and data communication costs, improve their applications and algorithms, and create new possibilities in the automotive systems of tomorrow.”", "entities": [[0, 6, "headquarters_loc"], [35, 41, "org_in_focus"], [49, 59, "money_funded"], [99, 105, "headquarters_loc"], [134, 140, "org_in_focus"], [314, 318, "year_founded"], [347, 357, "money_funded"], [379, 395, "investor"], [400, 424, "investor"], [456, 468, "cumulative"]]}

A huge portion of time and resources for a trial goes into patient recruitment, but it’s still mostly ‘What did we do before?’ instead of ‘What’s best right now?’”\n\nThe successful conduct of clinical trials is a prerequisite for any new drug to obtain marketing approval. For conclusive results, clinical trials often have to recruit hundreds or even thousands of patients across numerous hospitals in multiple countries. Thus site selection is critical, yet today roughly 30% of sites selected fail to recruit a single patient. Estimates suggest that this type of inefficiency drives up total trial costs by roughly 25%.\n\nInato solves this problem by bringing real improvement in three areas:\n\nAutomation: Data collection, structuring and analysis is entirely automated;\n\nTrust: Algorithms cross-check dozens of data sources to improve data reliability;\n\nIntelligence: In-house AI provides personalized insights that allow Inato’s clients to focus on tasks where they can leverage their expertise.\n\n“Our system takes into account over 200,000 hospital departments housing more than 1.2M investigators with experience in 900,000+ trials.” Davarpanah noted. “That’s way more than is done today, and it gives a much more exhaustive look at potential sites while also providing more accurate predictions for how many patients each site will recruit.”\n\nSaving money on clinical trials is already an important question given the financial pressures placed on health care systems around the world regarding drug costs for their citizens. And recruitment in particular is poised to become a critical issue as drug discovery aims at specific diseases with the latest medical breakthroughs.\n\nDr Jean-David Zeitoun, the co-founder and Chief Medical Officer of Inato commented: “Increasingly, industry players are trying to move into “precision medicine”, with treatments targeting more precisely defined patient groups (in terms of disease, personal characteristics, etc.). Consequently, clinical trials have to draw from narrower patient pools, and drugs’ addressable markets are shrinking.”\n\nAccording to Inato, aiming at site selection has already started paying off. In addition to the new fundraising round, Inato has already signed several contracts with major players in the pharmaceutical industry, was selected among 450 candidates to receive Sanofi’s prize for the Best Health Startup using Big Data, and is one of the top 40 startups out of 1000 global candidates that has been shortlisted to work with Bayer.", "entities": [[0, 5, "headquarters_loc"], [12, 17, "org_in_focus"], [25, 37, "money_funded"], [122, 127, "org_in_focus"], [139, 151, "money_funded"], [260, 274, "investor"], [276, 288, "investor"], [290, 303, "investor"], [322, 336, "investor"], [359, 373, "investor"], [666, 671, "headquarters_loc"], [701, 705, "year_founded"]]}

LCA and Laplanche along with Carrie Dolan, LCA’s former CFO, also were charged with improperly adjusting fund returns.\n\nAll three have agreed to settle the agency’s charges against them and will pay more than $4.2 million in combined penalties. The SEC also barred Laplanche from the securities industry.\n\nAccording to the SEC’s order, LCA provides investment advisory services to several private funds that purchase loan interests offered by LendingClub Corporation, a publicly-traded online marketplace lending company. LCA and Laplanche caused one of the private funds it managed to purchase interests in certain loans that were at risk of going unfunded, to benefit LendingClub, not the fund, in breach of LCA’s fiduciary duty. The order also finds that LCA, Laplanche, and Dolan improperly adjusted monthly returns for this fund and other LCA-managed funds to improve the returns they reported to fund investors.\n\n“Investment advisers have an obligation to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own,” said Daniel Michael, Chief of the SEC’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit. “By using funds managed by LCA to benefit its parent company, LCA and Laplanche failed to do so.”\n\n“Investors depend on fund advisers to give them the straight scoop on performance so they can make informed investment decisions,” said Jina Choi, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office. “Advisers who adjust their valuation processes to boost results are in breach of their duties to investors.”\n\nThe SEC’s order finds that LCA, Laplanche, and Dolan each violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. To settle the SEC’s charges, LCA, Laplanche and Dolan agreed to pay penalties of $4 million, $200,000, and $65,000, respectively. Laplanche also agreed to a securities industry bar and investment company prohibition. The SEC’s order permits Laplanche to apply for re-entry after three years. LCA, Laplanche, and Dolan agreed to the entry of the SEC’s order without admitting or denying the findings.\n\nThe SEC’s Enforcement Division determined not to recommend charges against LendingClub Corporation, which promptly self-reported its executives’ misconduct following a review initiated by its board of directors, thoroughly remediated, and provided extraordinary cooperation with the agency’s investigation. LCA also reimbursed approximately $1 million to investors who were adversely impacted by the improperly adjusted monthly returns.\n\nThe SEC’s investigation was conducted by Jason Casey and Amy Sumner of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit and Chrissy Filipp and Crystal Boodoo of the San Francisco Regional Office. The case was supervised by Laura Metcalfe, Monique Winkler, and Erin Schneider. The SEC appreciates the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Justice.", "entities": []}

Devialet says it's managed to double its turnover every year for the past five years, hitting €33 million in 2015.\n\nThe distribution deal with Apple should help the company sustain that growth, but Devialet is also opening 3 of its own stores in the United States this year, and apart from selling wireless speakers it's also working on licensing its patented audio technologies to a wide range of partners (think manufacturers of TV sets, cars, phones, computers and whatnot).\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the company can continue to execute on its ambitious plans and make a serious mark on the high-end speaker market and cut licensing deals.\n\nOn a side note, I just had the pleasure of checking out the Phantom speakers in person at the recent SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas, and they sound downright amazing (and this is coming from a very happy Sonos user).

The platform is the industry’s first solution that unifies a mobile application development platform (MADP), mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), Application Programming Interface (API) management, and platform as-a-service (PaaS) infrastructures under a single, open and standards-based mobile infrastructure platform. Kony MobileFabric dramatically speeds time to market of building enterprise mobile apps, shortens time spent on app development to more than 65 percent, and offers businesses a scalable and future-proof mobile strategy solution.\n\n“Unlike traditional enterprise application development, the name of the game in the world of mobile apps is continuous speed to market, agile responsiveness and a compelling user experience,” said Burley Kawasaki, senior vice president of Products, Kony, Inc. “The challenge that businesses are facing is the level of complexity that comes with enterprise mobile app development. Today our customers have to make difficult choices on which different technology platform to pick that supports their requirements. Kony MobileFabric is the first of its kind to considerably reduce this complexity by delivering an open, standards based, and unified mobile infrastructure platform regardless of their mobile development needs.”\n\n“The demand for high-velocity app deployment will overwhelm infrastructure and operations teams that are not staffed, budgeted, or prepared to handle a rapid scale-up of mobile apps,” wrote Michael Facemire, principal analyst and Jeffrey Hammond, vice president, principal analyst, in a recent Forrester report. “In turn, developers will look for options that light up in hours, scale transparently, and ‘just work.’ As a result, expect further blurring of the BaaS and mobile middleware markets.”1\n\nBy converging the most popular development platforms, Kony MobileFabric delivers customers the following benefits:\n\nFaster Time to Market : Kony MobileFabric removes the complexity and effort spent integrating multiple technologies in a typical enterprise mobile development project, with pre-built back-end services for identity, integration, orchestration, messaging and location services.

Here’s how to remove it!.\n\nUnless you were sitting under the rock for the last week, you’ve heard of the FaceApp. Does that ring any bells?

Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nLooks cool right? Well, this app allows users to upload photos of their faces and have them automatically edited to look like their future selves, replete with wrinkles and greying hair. Notably, this app gained a massive 4.8 ratings on the App Store and 80 million active users.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe FaceApp uses advanced Artificial Intelligence and Neural network technology to detect the ideal spots for wrinkles, smile, grey hairs and other features on your face.\n\nPrivacy concerns…!\n\nIt’s all fun, and we happily skip past the privacy aspect until someone reveals that FaceApp headquarters is in Saint Petersburg, Russia. To make is more precise, a Russian company called Wireless Lab owns FaceApp, and the Russians are known for flexing the democracy rules and aboveboard online activities.\n\nWhat’s the rumor circulating online?\n\nAs per rumors, the Russian app appears to gain access to the photo libraries of those who download it and then stores them on external servers.\n\nSecondly, when the user submits a photo on FaceApp, it is processed and stored on its server. There is no clarity of what happens to image upon processing, which acts as an alarming factor in terms of privacy concerns.\n\nFaceApp official statement!\n\nAfter being flooded with complaints, FaceApp publicly addressed privacy concerns stating that user images are not shared with third parties, nor uploaded to the Russia-based server. Additionally, the company accepts user requests for personal data to be deleted. FaceApp claims most photos will be removed within 48 hours anyway citing overload.\n\nTo those, who want to remove their data from FaceApp, can request through the app by clicking Settings -> Support -> Report a bug with “privacy” in the subject line.\n\nExperts ‘Say’!\n\nMany experts suggest that the app isn’t doing anything particularly unusual in either its code or its network traffic. They also propose that people should think about how their data will be used before sharing it with an unknown app.\n\nAdditionally, they pinpointed the fact that the terms of use regarding FaceApp are no different from any of the multiple social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter).\n\nWhy should you be aware?\n\nMany cybersecurity experts believe that photos could be used in unexpected ways, considering the app’s terms and conditions. Some claims that the picture could be used overseas, including Russia, whose government has been accused of interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On top of that, the company doesn’t explain how it protects user content stored on its servers as well.\n\nBaptiste Robert, a French security researcher, said that the app was not compliant with the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n“When you upload your photo, you have no idea how your photo is used,” Robert said, noting that the app’s terms and conditions are vague.“Don’t rush to use this application because you don’t know how your data is used after that.”\n\nFaceApp’s long history!\n\nIf you think FaceApp is new, then you are wrong! FaceApp in the past achieved popularity and extensive criticism for introducing a series of ‘racist’ selfie filters and ‘ethnicity’ change filters respectively.\n\nBeing cautious is the key!\n\nAll said and done, this is not the first time and won’t be the last either! Well, a bit more caution would be prudent, when you sharing data with any third-party app.\n\nAre you considering staying on the safe side? If yes, you must delete everything on your phone, including Facebook and Instagram, considering Zuckerberg’s long and troubling history of user privacy violations.\n\nWhat do you think about FaceApp?

The software currently supports Java, Scala, and Javascript, whereas Swift is on the way. Aware of the low quality that most code generators offer, the team claims to have dedicated their full attention in making this product stand out and be of true value to programmers. As a way to thank their community for the support and provide an incentive for further growth of other startup companies, Drytools have also announced free use of the software for other early stage domestic startups.\n\nThe company managed to secure its funding from the Enterprise Innovation Fund, announced last September by SC Ventures.

This RPG’s functionality is also expanded by a number of social and viral capabilities, allowing users to share their progress as they would in a social game. The sci-fi game’s space setting is transported by console-like, premium-quality 3D graphics based on the most advanced Adobe Flash and Away3D technology.\n\nAlexander Seifert, CEO of Pro 3 Games, describes the development of their social browser game. “Over time, we want to build a community that will be an active force in the continuing development of the ‘Starforce Delta’ universe.

Starting today, pet parents can sign up on the Ollie website to have freshly made food delivered to their door, complete with nutritional information and a tailored feeding plan for their dog.\n\n\n\nFounders Alex Douzet, Gabby Slome and Randy Jimenez shared a love of athletics, health, wellness, and of course dogs. They conceptualized the idea with seasoned entrepreneur and investor Ben Sun, who runs NYC-based venture capital firm Primary Venture Partners and who was among the first investors in unicorn ecommerce giants Jet.com and Coupang. Primary helped them incubate Ollie when Alex and Gabby realized their recent rescue dogs were both suffering from weight gain and there wasn't a convenient alternative to overly processed kibble or canned food.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Ollie announces a $4.4 million seed round co-led by Primary Ventures and Lerer Hippeau Ventures with participation from Canaan Partners, and others. The funding will be used to further build out Ollie's product line, expand the team and continue to create the best possible experience for customers and their pets.\n\n\n\n'The $25 billion pet food market is growing every day, but has long been plagued with issues of massive recalls, poor ingredients, and lack of transparency,' said Alex Douzet, co-founder and CEO of Ollie. 'After extensive research and understanding what really goes into the food that the majority of dogs eat, we saw a huge opportunity to improve what we feed our pets in a healthy, sustainable way. By addressing many of the misconceptions people have about over-the-shelf mass market kibble and canned food, we can help pets live better, longer lives and develop richer bonds with their families.'\n\n\n\n'Dogs eat the same thing every day, which makes it even more important for them to get exactly the right nutrition with every meal,' said Gabby Slome, co-founder and CXO of Ollie. 'As pet parents, we learned first hand that the industry perpetuates opaque feeding guidelines, which means we could be feeding our dogs twice as many calories than they actually need. In order to tackle this issue, we assembled the best possible team of veterinary nutritionists, technologists, and coupled that with extensive industry and product formulation research to set a new standard for what we should feed our pets. By leveraging data and technology, we can ensure the food portions match the exact needs of individual pets so they maintain the ideal weight for healthier lives.'\n\n\n\nThe Food\n\nOllie's recipes are vet-formulated and gently cooked to preserve the right amount of nutrients. Made using 98% natural, human-grade ingredients and 2% supplements, the food is fairly sourced and prepared in a USDA inspected and FDA regulated facility, alongside human food that is sold at top tier retailers.

{"text": "HouseMe investor Geddes Capital secures R200m debt facility from UK company.\n\nCape Town based financier Geddes Capital — which last year invested in SA startups HouseMe and Seon — has secured R200-million from a UK company to lend to small businesses.\n\nGeddes Capital CEO Brent Geddes (pictured above) told Ventureburn in a phone call yesterday that the lender and investor secured the R200-million from a UK-based company, Hyson Lucky Dragon, after he met the founder last year in Cape Town.\n\nGeddes said the new facility will help the financier, which he founded in 2017 (he was later joined by partners Craig White and Warren Deats), to ramp up lending to local small businesses.\n\nHe says the financier is already in discussion with four or five companies, all in the fast-moving consumer goods sector. It’s a sector which Geddes, who owns a pomegranates farm in nearby Wellington, is very familiar with.\n\nGeddes Capital which has invested in SA startups Seon and HouseMe, has secured R200m from UK-based Hyson Lucky Dragon\n\nSo far the financier has lent R60-million to 45 businesses — through secured loans of between R500 000 to R7.5-million, repayable over three to 18 months.\n\nThose funded include businesses in various sectors — from logistics, to farming to clothing and manufacturing. About 60% of those the financier has funded are based in Cape Town, with the remainder located in Durban and Gauteng.\n\nMost of the small businesses he’s funded have come to the financier via a network of accountants and lawyers. At present Geddes says he and his business partners fly to Johannesburg or Durban when they need to approve deals there.\n\nInterest rates of up to 42%\n\nBut it doesn’t come cheap. At an interest rate of 2.5% to 3.5% a month (an annual interest rate of between 30% to 42% a year) Geddes admits his finance itn’t anywhere near as affordable as a bank loan.\n\nWhile the loan agreement can include a bullet repayment, Geddes says he isn’t a fan of pushing the term period beyond 18 months, because of how costly it will become for the client to service the loan.\n\nFinanciers like Geddes (and bigger operations like Business Partners) benefit because of the large amount of red tape and long waiting times that many small businesses in South Africa have to contend with when seeking a bank loan.\n\nEquity stakes in Seon, HouseMe\n\nGeddes Capital has used the proceeds from interest it’s made off lending to small businesses, to take equity stakes in local startups — with the financier taking part in a funding round late last year involving SA proptech HouseMe (see this story).\n\nGeddes Capital committed R3-million in the round which it participated in with other investors.\n\nIn addition, Geddes said his financier has also been providing the startup with a monthly revolving bridging capital facility of about R100 000, which the startup lends out and then repays, in an arrangement that ends next month.\n\nThe financier also invested R1-million in Seon, a company founded by Moroccan born Samia Haimoua and three German co-founders in 2017 which has developed a wearable panic button device (see this story).\n\nFintech platform plans\n\nGeddes revealed that he and his partners are looking at setting up a tech platform — similar to that of startups such as a Lulalend — to make it easier to service the high demand from small businesses for loans.\n\nHowever, he points out that this will likely only be for smaller sized loans — such as those under R500 000. It’s more difficult to lend out larger-sized loans that demand more due diligence and interaction from his team, he explains.\n\nIn addition, he’s also keen to create a lending or investment product for amounts of above R10-million, pointing out that most private equity funds in South Africa are loathe to consider investing anything below R20-million let alone R50-million in local medium-sized firms.\n\nIt’s not bad going for a farmer and former investment banker (with over 10 years experience with Rand Merchant Bank), whose interest in funding small businesses was peaked when he was asked by Pick n Pay to get involved in a supplier development initiative.\n\nIt’s got him keen in investing in a bouquet of artisanal health and food companies that supply local retailers and building this up into an offering he can later look at selling on to bigger investors.\n\nSouth Africa needs more financiers like Brent Geddes willing to lend to those banks don’t want to — even if such finance may cost many small businesses an arm and a leg.\n\nRead more: HouseMe secures ‘multi-million’ rand deal, declines to reveal who investors are\n\nRead more: How Moroccan entrepreneur chose SA to launch wearable security device Seon\n\n*Correction: While Brent Geddes runs a pomegranate farm he does not have a canning facility. We have corrected the story.\n\nEditor’s note (15 August 2019): Subsequent to the publication of this story, Geddes explained that before starting Geddes Capital he had worked for Rand Merchant Bank for over 10 years.\n\nDisclosure: Stephen Timm matriculated in 1996 from Cape Town’s Westerford high school in the same class together with Geddes Capital CEO Brent Geddes.\n\nFeatured image: Geddes Capital CEO Brent Geddes (Supplied)", "entities": [[17, 31, "org_in_focus"], [40, 45, "money_funded"], [46, 50, "type_of_funding"], [65, 75, "investor"], [78, 87, "headquarters_loc"], [104, 118, "org_in_focus"], [192, 204, "money_funded"], [212, 222, "investor"], [253, 267, "org_in_focus"], [386, 398, "money_funded"], [424, 442, "investor"], [568, 572, "year_founded"], [909, 923, "org_in_focus"], [988, 993, "money_funded"], [1008, 1026, "investor"]]}

The funding round was led by IAN members Naveen Gupta and Dinesh Goel.\n\nThe startup plans to utilise the funds for product development, filing patents and global certifications for its entire tech stack and is currently focusing on cold chain solutions for pharma, F&V, dairy, meats, processed and frozen food, ecommerce and retail.\n\nTagBox enables organisations to create reliable and sustainable Cold Chains with the use of IoT, Advanced Analytics, and Automation. It was founded in the year 2016, by Adarsh Kumar, Saumitra Singh, and Sameer Singh. TagBox helps organisations improve their cold chains by giving real-time visibility and predictive insights for an end to end cold chain health at any level of granularity. Ex. Box, pallet, cold room, refrigerated vehicle or retail store/pharmacy.\n\nCommenting on the fund raise, Adarsh Kumar, Cofounder TagBox said, “We are incredibly privileged to be invested in by such an amazing investment network. We believe that IAN’s experience and in-depth knowledge would provide a significant boost to our quest to cost-effectively and reliably tag every single box that carries cold chain products, monitors its health real-time and predicts and prevent cold chain failures.”\n\nThe current cold chain industry is globally a $10Bn market, but the ecosystem is riddled with inefficiencies. The key problem areas in cold chains are:\n\nLow or fragmented visibility and traceability into cold chain health and performance\n\nInability to meet compliance requirements, leading to penalties\n\nProduct spoilage, shrinkage & expiry losses due to mismanagement and breakdowns\n\nSignificant human dependence for quality control;\n\nvery low automation: High Cold Chain cost (4X of regular supply chain)\n\nLow SLAs: The current solutions are primarily ‘Hardware’ oriented and provide raw telemetry data to organisations in formats that can be barely used with limited data historical storage.\n\nAddressing these challenges, Tagbox provides comprehensive solutions using IoT, Advanced Analytics, and Automation to integrate the client’s ERP data with sensor data for advanced analytics, thereby directly improving the cold chains.\n\nTheir hardware layer consists of Tag360 sensors that can monitor temperature, humidity, vibrations, and light; TagHub ultra-low power gateways which transmit data from Tag360 sensors to the cloud via wi-fi or cellular network and TagLink Mobile App can be used by authorised field personnel to transmit sensor data when needed, especially from restricted locations like ports or customs.\n\nCommenting on the investment Naveen Gupta said, “There is no doubt that technology has given cold chain monitoring a significant boost, and space is growing at a rapid pace. We strongly believe that the solutions provided by TagBox, not only differentiates from other players but also has the potential substantially develop the future of India’s Food waste management.”\n\nAccording to a Markets and Markets report, the cold chain monitoring market is expected to grow from $ 3.11 Bn in 2015 to $ 6.23 Bn by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 9.84% between 2016 and 2022. The report also finds that the cold chain monitoring market in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest rate between 2016 and 2022 on the back of the growing demand for food, increase in population relying on medication, and rapid urbanisation.\n\nHowever, almost 40% of India’s total food production is lost in transit, wasted by consumers or damaged (according to the United Nations Development Program), and nearly 80% of medicines produced lose their potency due to inferior temperature controls during transport. “No doubt that the market has tremendous potential, but what differentiates us from others is delivering our tech efficiently, with precision and timeliness,” added Adarsh.\n\nSome of the well-known global players in the cold chain monitoring space are US-based Sensitech, Inc., ORBCOMM, and Monnit Corp; and the Swiss-based Berlinger & Co. and ELPRO_BUCHS AG. The sector is growing rapidly opening doors for the emerging ventures.

This funding will help Chargebee expand globally and improve proximity to customer locations. The capital will be used for increased investments in product, sales marketing, and growth initiatives.\n\nHarley Miller, Vice President at Insight Venture Partners, will also join Chargebee’s board.\n\nWith this round, Chargebee has netted total investment of $24.7 Mn. Earlier in March 2015, the startup had raised $5 Mn in Series B round offunding to set up satellite offices in the US, UK and Australia.\n\n“Since our last investment, we’ve grown from a 37 member team based in India, to a 135+ member global team that’s expanded into Silicon Valley. We now support 7,000+ customers in 50+ countries and have added support for payment gateways such as GoCardless, Adyen, Apple Pay, Chase Paymentech and others, to our growing list of gateway partnerships,” said Krish Subramanian, founder, Chargebee, in an email interaction with Inc42.\n\nChargeBee was founded by Rajaraman S, Thiyagarajan T, KP Saravanan and Krish Subramanian in 2011. It focuses on helping startups, and particularly those in the Saas space, get more from their billing subscriptions. It primarily operates in the small and medium business Saas space.\n\nThe startup offers a payment gateway agnostic subscription billing solution, complementing gateways like Stripe, Braintree, PayPal, Adyen and many others. Chargebee powers the recurring revenue engines of both B2B and B2C services across various industry verticals like SaaS, Digital Media, eCommerce, and IoT.\n\n“We help our customers launch their business and grow into new countries, without having to worry about compliance, tax rules, language, currency, and even new revenue models. We take a lot of pride in remaining behind the scenes while powering our customer’s businesses. We want to be the AWS of Subscription Billing.” added Krish.\n\nHe further shared that the company’s long term bet lies in the increasing shift towards the subscription business model, with many existing and new products now being sold as subscriptions. The focus is to keep the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) very low for its customers by having a product that does not require a lot of professional services to implement, and at the same time delivers on the promise of deep last mile integrations.\n\n“Just like how businesses don’t build their own CRM / Helpdesk, we believe that businesses don’t need to build their own billing systems. Our near future efforts are aligned towards realising this potential. We’re close to break-even profitability. We’ve scaled our customers’ revenues to a point where it’s getting closer to the billion-dollar mark. Our aim is to continue building the modern billing system, for modern business users in subscription businesses,” he added.\n\nAccording to a March 2016 report by Google and Accel Partners India, this space is expected to grow to at least $76 Bn by 2020, from levels of roughly $24 Bn in 2015. The latest funding round, will certainly help Chargebee push its efforts towards achieving profitability in near future.", "entities": [[5, 11, "money_funded"], [27, 42, "investor"], [44, 53, "org_in_focus"], [94, 101, "headquarters_loc"], [172, 181, "org_in_focus"], [193, 199, "money_funded"], [235, 259, "investor"], [266, 274, "type_of_funding"], [336, 350, "investor"], [355, 378, "investor"], [690, 699, "org_in_focus"], [731, 739, "cumulative"], [1310, 1319, "org_in_focus"], [1402, 1406, "year_founded"]]}

Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nIf you are in need of a workspace, preferably a stunner in terms of looks for your self-proclaimed startup but you don’t want to be captive for years in the same place, then the coworking culture will interest you.\n\nMindspace is a coworking startup providing shared workspaces and meeting rooms for the startups, businesses, and entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, Mindspace acquired KleinKantoor, the leading Dutch coworking company to expand its footprint into the Netherlands. Now the company is all set to open its first co-working space in the heart of Amsterdam in Herengracht as soon as by August 2018. Mindspace also plans to open one more co-working space near the Amsterdam central station and another one in the Utrecht city.\n\nExpanding rapidly in Europe\n\nThe coworking startup based in Tel Aviv debuted in 2014. In just a year, the company expanded its presence to Germany and witnessed a quick success. Mindspace tripled its size in Germany in just a few years of entering the market. “We’ve got to know that the company is “spread across 8 locations in Germany including 3 in Berlin, 3 in Munich, 1 in Frankfurt and Hamburg each,” notes Danielle Avrahami, Expansion Lead, Mindspace during an exclusive conversation with Silicon Canals.\n\nSince then, the company has expanded its presence in Europe operating in Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom. As the Netherlands is a hotbed of startups and is home to old classical buildings, it has become a prime market for Mindspace.\n\nDan Zakai, CEO, and co-founder at Mindspace said “Amsterdam is one of the highest-barrier-to-entry markets in Europe. The city enjoys strong economic growth but experiences very low vacancy of office space. KleinKantoor’s founder, Mr. Emiel Doorgeest together with RJB Group of Companies, built an extraordinary portfolio of coworking spaces in rare buildings.”\n\nCompetition for existing co-working spaces rivals!\n\nThere are a few prominent coworking startups already in Amsterdam such as Spaces, WeWork, etc. In order to stand out from the crowd, Mindspace intends to offer “a unique design, establish a vibrant community, mark a difference in their professionalism, create an engaging community and offer a personal touch,” adds Edita Lobaciute, Global Community Lead at Mindspace while in conversation with Silicon Canals at the company event held in Amsterdam recently.\n\nThey will let the startup communities stay connected via a mobile app. It can also be used to book meeting rooms and get to know about what’s happening in the digital world.\n\nBring communities together\n\nMindspace will host a series of events in Amsterdam to keep the communities engaged. The team at the coworking startup will host weekly happy hours wherein local and national partners will take part. In Berlin, the company hosts happy hours and wellbeing sessions with a focus on meditation, yoga, and nutrition.\n\nA local feel\n\nMindspace intends to focus on retaining the native feel of workspaces in Amsterdam without changing them a lot. In addition to the design and beauty, the startup will rope in local artists in the city to give a native feel to the workplaces.\n\nNo unnecessary rentals\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, the coworking startup will understand the budget of the partner company requiring a workspace. This will let them find out the best solution, which will suit the business. Also, this will avoid the businesses and startups from paying unnecessary rental for something that they don’t need at that point in time.\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more updates in the tech startup world.", "entities": []}

SurveySparrow claims this spin on the survey’s UI hikes the chances of survey completion by 40%.\n\nThe tool also allows organisations to manage customer experience surveys, employee pulse surveys and market feedback surveys on its platform. In addition to surveys, the company also offers two other products including net promoter score (NPS) and the audience for market research.\n\nThe company works on a subscription-based model, businesses can register on the platform at a starting price of $19 per month.\n\nSince its launch, SurveySparrow has conducted over 20K surveys with over 8K customers spread across 108 countries for multinational partners such as DiDi, PaySafe, FedEx, Deloitte Digital, SAP, and Siemens. The startup is now set to clock more than 20K customers by the end of 2019.\n\n“We are bullish on customer experience becoming a crucial decision point in choosing the right service, with the world moves towards a subscription service economy. We believe customer experience will be the biggest factor influencing buying decisions,” said Shihab Muhammed, cofounder, SurveySparrow.\n\nSaaS Industry Overview\n\nAccording to a report by Google and Accel Partners, the Indian SaaS market is predicted to become a $10 Bn revenue industry by the year of 2025. The report also added that global SaaS industry can be predicted to become $132 Bn revenue industry by the year of 2020, in which India is likely to contribute nearly 8% of the global SaaS revenue by 2025.\n\nFurther talking about the global online survey software market, SurveySparrow team said the market is valued at $4.06 Bn. Other startups offering online survey tools in India include SurveyMonkey, Touchmetric and SoGoSurvey.\n\nIn September 2018, customer experience management software Cloudcherry had raised $9 Mn in an extended Series A funding round led by Pelion Venture Partners. Subsequently, a Bengaluru-based SaaS platform Hiver (previously Grexit) raised a $4 Mn fund from Kalaari, and Kae Capital in October 2018.\n\nMore recently in February 2019, software arm of Ebix Inc acquired a 80% stake in the Delhi-based SaaS travel platform, Zillious Solutions.", "entities": [[0, 22, "investor"], [31, 38, "money_funded"], [42, 44, "headquarters_loc"], [59, 72, "org_in_focus"], [195, 197, "headquarters_loc"], [243, 256, "org_in_focus"], [268, 275, "money_funded"], [279, 283, "type_of_funding"], [297, 319, "investor"], [709, 722, "org_in_focus"], [746, 750, "year_founded"]]}

The startup has just raised a funding round of €570k from several angel investors, including Greg Marsh, Demetrios Zoppos, Chris Bruce, Michael Whitfield, and Doug Monro – the majority existing investors. The additional funding will be used to expand the team and the startup’s marketing efforts.\n\n“Switchd is an exciting young company in an industry ripe for change, whilst being led by an impressive and driven team,” said Monro. “The market has huge potential. Their service, meanwhile, is genuinely on the customers’ side, whilst also being backed by some great tech. With Switchd now pushing for growth after fine-tuning their product, and a new brand redesign about to be unveiled, it’s an incredibly exciting time to be involved in the company. I believe that they have the potential to become the Zoopla of energy switching”.\n\nSwitchd was launched after co-founders Llewellyn Kinch and Thomas Rogers saw a way to help consumers save more money than comparison sites and protect against expensive standard variable tariffs, and the potential to cut down on the hassles associated with switching energy providers, using a high-tech solution.\n\nBased in London, 2018 was Switchd’s first full calendar year as a company and has seen significant changes to its product and customer growth. Based in a cheap and cheerful office in Soho, it has grown over the course of the year from just Llewellyn and Tom to a five-person team, with a sixth employee due to join later this month. 2018 was primarily devoted to developing the product and ensuring it fitted customer needs. Features such as excluding certain suppliers, choosing fixed price tariffs, and going green are particular favourites with Switchd members.\n\nUnlike comparison sites and most auto-switching services, it switches to the whole of the market to get customers the best deal. Other services can’t do this because they rely on commission from suppliers, whereas Switchd charges the customer a small monthly fee (from £1.99). This means they’re truly independent and on the side of their members to get them the best deal.\n\nSwitchd is “truly on the customer’s side,” commented Kinch. “Whereas some comparison sites are essentially marketing machines for energy suppliers and don’t get the customer the best deal.”\n\nSwitchd is now looking forward to saving more money for more people in the year ahead, as auto-switching becomes more mainstream.", "entities": [[0, 2, "headquarters_loc"], [31, 38, "org_in_focus"], [46, 51, "money_funded"], [96, 100, "year_founded"], [102, 109, "org_in_focus"], [272, 277, "money_funded"], [318, 328, "investor"], [330, 346, "investor"], [348, 359, "investor"], [361, 378, "investor"], [384, 394, "investor"], [1383, 1389, "headquarters_loc"], [1400, 1407, "org_in_focus"]]}

The new funding means Flex-Appeal has now raised a total of €1.6 million over the past 3 years.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nFlex-Appeal is a modern employee app that allows retail, hotel and hospitality companies to reach, train and engage their front-line employees. The Rotterdam-based firm has rapidly amassed an impressive list of customers, including brands such as Albert Heijn, Jumbo, Gamma, Humphrey’s and New York Pizza. Through the use of the app, these companies see significant improvements in the areas of employee turnover, customer satisfaction and productivity. “A lot of companies are still using outdated means of communication, such as newsletters, intranet and simple clipboards; this is part of the reason why we’re making such a massive impact,” says Ruben Wieman, one of Flex-Appeal’s two founders.\n\nA Rotterdam company with ambition\n\nThe new round of funding is meant to spur Flex-Appeal’s ambitions for growth. The money will be invested in product development, sales and marketing. The company is actively looking for new talent as it expects to expand its team from 9 to 20 people before the end of 2019. As part of this expansion, Flex-Appeal recently relocated to a brand new office in the Groothandelsgebouw, right in the centre of Rotterdam. “We’re convinced that this city is increasingly becoming a hotspot for talent and innovation”, say Flex-Appeal’s founders.\n\nExperienced entrepreneurs get on board\n\nThe new financing round is led by Arco van Nieuwland, co-founder of Exact Software. Van Nieuwland left Exact back in 2008 in order to start his new firm, Yuki. Through CNBB Venture Partners he also invests in software companies with great potential, including Bynder. Next to CNBB, a number of experienced angel investors are also participating in the round.

These are people who don’t work behind a desk in an office, but for example on the shop floor of a supermarket or restaurant. “This market consists of 2.8 billion people worldwide, almost 80% of all employees”, according to Ruben Wieman. “It’s a real challenge for companies to reach this group of employees. Many firms currently use ineffective and outdated means, such as an intranet, e-mail, WhatsApp and paper documents.”\n\n“Flex-Appeal is the modern way to truly connect with front-line employees”, adds his co-founder Guido Schmitz. “We’re offering companies one single app for all their internal communication, onboarding, and e-learning. It is this combination of functionalities in particular that makes the app so loved by employees. As an example: employees from the largest Jumbo-franchiser in the Netherlands, sent each other more than 4.000 public and over 30.000 private messages just in the first month of using the app.”\n\n— Press release\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more updates in the tech startup world.", "entities": [[0, 5, "investor"], [25, 34, "headquarters_loc"], [58, 69, "org_in_focus"], [101, 110, "headquarters_loc"], [134, 145, "org_in_focus"], [191, 199, "money_funded"], [244, 262, "investor"], [286, 297, "org_in_focus"], [324, 336, "cumulative"], [666, 675, "headquarters_loc"]]}

At the moment, Tunisia is trying to improve the environment of entrepreneurs and investors, especially through regulatory improvements such as the Startup Act. It is for all these reasons that the Investor Academy comes just in time to generate more investment opportunities,” said Yehia Houry, managing director of Flat6Labs Tunis.\n\nTunisian is a pioneer in terms of government legislating for the growth of local startup ecosystems, with its approach being mirrored elsewhere on the continent. However, in terms of homegrown angel networks, it lags behind. Led by the African Business Angel Network (ABAN), the continent is seeing huge growth in early-stage investment.\n\nThe Lagos Angel Network, set up in 2012, was an early forerunner of a group of leading networks that also includes Cairo Angels in Egypt, Jozi Angels in South Africa and the Viktoria Business Angels Network in Kenya. Recent launches have also taken place in Mali, Benin, Senegal, and The Gambia, while there are also groups forming outside of traditional hubs, such as the SSE Angel Network, which backs startups in the South-South/South-East regions of Nigeria. All-women angel networks are also launching, like the Lagos-based Rising Tide Africa and Cape Town’s Dazzle Angels.\n\nFlat6Labs Tunis and its partners hope to encourage similar developments inTunisia, with one of the partners, PE firm Attijari Sicar, announcing a new offer specifically for business angels. The company committed to matching any investment made by any angel present at the event in any startup that was worth more than TND100,000 (US$35,000).\n\n“With this collaboration with business angels, we will create a trusting relationship between startups, business angels and the Sicar,” said Yasser Lourimi, general manager of Attijari Sicar.\n\nThe event also saw the launch of the Maghreb Angel Investor Network, a network of angels across the Maghreb region initiated by Noomane Fehri, ex-minister of ICT and current chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of B@Labs, which co-organised the event.\n\nGeorges Ghorra, the IFC’s resident representative in Tunisia, said Tunisian entrepreneurs could further grow with the help of a supportive ecosystem.\n\n“Events such as the Investor Academy help strengthen the connections between entrepreneurs, creating space for further collaboration, learning and growth,” he said.", "entities": []}

{"text": "CrowdRiff raises $11.6 million to help travel brands source photos in an Instagram world.\n\nToronto-based CrowdRiff has raised an $11.6 million Series A round as the visual content marketing company looks to expand the reach of its platform. The round was led by Leaders Fund, with participation from Alpha Capital, Gibraltar & Company, and BDC Capital.\n\nCrowdRiff allows travel and tourism brands to discover visuals that are likely to perform well with website visitors. While the solution sounds simple enough, its internal studies say that a large base of consumers relies on user-generated visual content—which they see as authentic—to make purchasing decisions.\n\n“Visuals are the language of modern-day travelers.”\n\n– Dan Holowack, CEO of CrowdRiff\n\n\n\n“A few years ago, user-generated content seemed like it was a temporary marketing solution for brands, but it has evolved and become a core part of brands’ social and website content, and even features prominently on the homepages of large brands,” said Dan Holowack, CrowdRiff’s CEO. “Today, UGC is used in every marketing channel, from visitor guides to digital ads and billboards. One of our customers did this in Times Square!”\n\nIf 10 million photos of a destination are posted on social media, it can be difficult to source usable, high-quality photos. Through the platform, brands can retain the rights to use content, and see what types of photos are most effective to have travelers clicking through. The company said it was one the first travel-focused Creative Platform Partners to join the Instagram Partner Program.\n\n“Visuals are the language of modern-day travelers,” said Holowack. “Around the world, it’s visual content that most heavily influences where people choose to travel and how they spend their money while abroad. We’re thrilled to accelerate our innovation and expansion in the travel sector and further enable travel brands and their agencies to effectively use visuals to attract and engage people throughout the travel buyer journey.”\n\nJoelle Maslaton, former Facebook growth lead, recently joined CrowdRiff’s board.\n\nWhile it initially targeted travel and tourism brands like destination marketing organizations, CrowdRiff will use the funding to move to other markets like airlines, attractions, and museums. For that reason, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are attractive target markets with highly-developed tourism sectors.\n\nThe company’s last announced funding round was $2.6 million CAD in March 2016. The company currently has 500 travel and tourism brands in 24 countries using the platform, and said it experienced 700 percent annual recurring revenue growth since 2015 in August 2018. Recently, Joelle Maslaton, former Facebook growth lead and current Gibraltar & Company VP and venture partner, joined its board.\n\nOne of its most recent product launches includes its Media Hub, a digital asset manager that enables customers to search, store, share, and collaborate on their visual content, both user-generated and professional.\n\n“We are super impressed with Dan and Abhi’s (Ajgaonkar) vision for the travel industry,” said Gideon Hayden, co-founder and partner at Leaders Fund. “In a short period of time, CrowdRiff sourced content is reaching millions of travelers every month who are at the beginning of their trip discovery process, and is resulting in more travel bookings for its customers. The team has a relentless focus on customer satisfaction and enabling travel brands to tell their stories in a vastly more compelling way. We are excited to support them on this journey.”", "entities": [[0, 9, "org_in_focus"], [17, 30, "money_funded"], [91, 98, "headquarters_loc"], [105, 114, "org_in_focus"], [129, 142, "money_funded"], [143, 151, "type_of_funding"], [262, 274, "investor"], [300, 313, "investor"], [315, 334, "investor"], [340, 351, "investor"]]}

Favvas and Boulanger had already moved from Canada to Silicon Valley in 2011 to build their previous startup. “At the time, I used to advise everyone to move to San Francisco if they could,” Favvas said in a statement to BetaKit. “Now, my advice is more nuanced, given the high cost of living, difficulty recruiting talent, and uncertain political and immigration environment.”\n\nThe company is planning on opening a Montreal office to hire local AI talent.\n\nAdditionally, Circle Medical has entered into a letter of intent to license its technology in 2019 to WELL Health, a network of primary care clinics in Canada, and is in discussions with other healthcare providers.\n\n“We are big believers in Circle Medical’s full-stack model,” said Ronny Conway, founder and general partner at A.Capital. “We love how they are using software to disrupt a large market with an asset-light approach.”\n\nCircle Medical powers telemedicine and pop-up clinics at 22 sites in the San Francisco Bay area.

{"text": "CareGuide makes strategic investment in fellow startup Qimple.\n\nToronto’s CareGuide is known for making its own road. The care marketplace startup, which has a portfolio of sites like Sitter.com and Housekeeper.com, has taken a unique approach to fundraising and growth: predominantly raising $4 million in seed funding from over 70 angel investors, and convincing RBC to supply $1 million in debt financing to gobble up the competitor which inspired its business. Today, CareGuide announced a strategic investment in Moncton-based Qimple.\n\nQimple provides an online hiring platform CareGuide uses to ensure its marketplaces are well-stocked with nannies, housekeepers, and so on. While startup founders often make early-stage investments in other startups (and Brian Sharwood, VP of Operations at CareGuide, and an angel investor in CareGuide before joining the company full time, is also personally investing in Qimple), company-level investments are something usually expected of, say, Slack, which has a $3.8 billion valuation. But at this point, the unorthodox is the expected for CareGuide’s Chief Executive Officer Dad, John Philip Green.\n\nCalling the investment a “modestly-sized bet” for CareGuide (terms of the investment were not disclosed), Green explained that the deal evolved naturally in an exclusive interview with BetaKit.\n\n“[Qimple founder Yves Boudreau] & I consult with each other on strategy as we build our adjacent companies. At some point we started working together,” Green said. “Recently when we discussed Qimple’s need for more capital in 2016, I believe it occurred to me first that CareGuide could help in that regard, in exchange for the more extensive partnership I wanted. The expanded partnership bolsters some core drivers to our care marketplaces.”\n\nBoudreau reinforced the notion that the investment worked at both the founder and core business levels.\n\n“When we opened the round, John thought it would make a lot of sense for CareGuide to invest given how continuously Qimple and CareGuide worked together,” he said. “When the conversation came up I was excited to have someone of John’s pedigree showcase so much enthusiasm and belief in what we were doing.”\n\nBoudreau also dismissed the notion that an investment from another startup rather than an institutional investor might send the signal to customers that the company could soon be acquired.\n\n“It sends an amazing signal, not only to customers, but to the eco-system as a whole,” Boudreau said. “Having one of Canada’s fastest and most recognized startups actively investing in us is yet another validation for our company. I believe it’ll open up more doors and increase our profile within our potential client base.”\n\n“Companies aren’t going to avoid using Qimple because we may be acquired someday. They’re using us because we fulfil a need that they have.”\n\nWhen I asked Green why he didn’t just buy Qimple outright, he was quick to avoid jumping to foregone conclusions. “Both companies are growing quickly,” he said. “Our partnership and minority equity stake suits us both well right now.”\n\n“Besides, Qimple appears to have little trouble raising money.”", "entities": [[0, 9, "investor"], [55, 61, "org_in_focus"], [472, 481, "investor"], [518, 525, "headquarters_loc"], [532, 538, "org_in_focus"]]}

No financial terms were disclosed. GCA Advisors served as financial adviser to LRN on the transaction with Sidley Austin providing legal counsel. And, Latham & Watkins served as legal counsel to Leeds Equity Partners.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nNEW YORK, USA – December 19, 2018. Leeds Equity Partners, LLC (“Leeds Equity”), the foremost private equity firm investing exclusively in the Knowledge Industries, announced today that it has completed a significant investment in LRN Corporation (“LRN” or the “Company”). LRN is a leading provider of ethics and compliance education, learning technology, data analytics and strategic advice that helps companies translate corporate values, operating principles and industry regulations with the objective of driving operational performance, reducing risks and creating sustainable competitive advantages. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nLeeds Equity, which manages over $1.7 billion in assets, seeks to acquire leading companies in sectors across the Knowledge Industries where the firm can partner with management to drive innovation, business growth and best-in-class customer outcomes. Leeds Equity developed an in-depth knowledge of LRN and the work it does with corporations through its decades-long experience in the governance, risk and compliance and software sectors and its relationship with Founder and CEO, Dov Seidman. LRN is the sixth platform investment for Leeds Equity Partners VI, L.P., Leeds Equity’s most recent fund, and the fourth significant investment in the legal and compliance vertical over its last two investment funds.\n\n“Since our founding in 1994, LRN has been pioneering an industry and been on a journey to create ever more impactful ways to help companies and their people do the right thing,” said Dov Seidman. “Society continues to set higher and higher standards for companies and their people and therefore, now is the time for LRN, as the recognized leader in the industry, to make a transformational move. Backed by Leeds Equity’s expertise and resources, we will grow through even greater investments in technology and further innovations in our products and services, such as mobile delivery, adaptive learning and data analytics — enabling us to better support our client-partners in educating and engaging their employees, assessing workplace conduct, guiding the right kind of principled and profitable behavior, and demonstrating the ROI of effective ethics and compliance initiatives.”\n\nOver the past 25 years, LRN has helped more than 20 million people working for companies around the world simultaneously navigate complex legal and regulatory environments and make ethical decisions, and has also helped hundreds of companies foster ethical, responsible, and inclusive cultures. LRN’s comprehensive learning and analytics platform, unrivaled subject matter expertise, as well as awardwinning content and localization capabilities address the unique needs of modern, global corporations at a time of intensifying focus and scrutiny on corporate and individual conduct — where ‘do it right’ corporate cultures are an urgent imperative and command unprecedented resources from managements and boards.\n\n“We are privileged to have been afforded the opportunity to partner with Dov and his team and to be a custodian of this remarkable and unique enterprise,” said Jeffrey T. Leeds, Managing Partner of Leeds Equity. “We admire how LRN has steadfastly acted on its belief, now widely acknowledged by business leaders, that behavior and culture not only matter, but are often the difference between success and failure. Moreover, LRN’s seriousness of purpose is matched by its commitment to efficacy. It is not enough to aspire; the quality of LRN’s unique, cloud-based SaaS technology solutions and content drives real impact on conduct from shop floors to corporate offices to the boardroom. Our partnership and planned investments in organic growth as well as in mergers and acquisitions will seek above all to support LRN’s objective of continuing to be the most valued and valuable company in the ethics and compliance sector,” said Leeds.\n\nTim Shriver, the Chairman of Leeds Equity’s Advisory Board said, “I have known Dov and Jeffrey for many years, and this partnership brings together their shared commitment to innovation in education and training and beyond. As the Chairman of Leeds Equity, I am thrilled with this opportunity to work with Dov. He has built a leading and trusted business out of a philosophy of respect, regard and inclusiveness.\n\nThis is the kind of work Leeds Equity was formed to do and the kind of company Leeds Equity was founded to partner with and support. We will also be fortunate to benefit from Dov’s leadership and advice on other Leeds Equity initiatives.”\n\n“Helping companies equip employees with the knowledge necessary to build a culture rooted in strong values, principles and moral behavior is an imperative that LRN is at the forefront of,” added Jacques Galante, Partner at Leeds Equity. “We are thrilled to formally partner with Dov Seidman and the LRN team to continue this mission, accelerate investment in the Company’s innovative learning platform, content and workflow tools and execute on LRN’s strategic objectives.”\n\nLatham & Watkins served as legal counsel to Leeds Equity Partners.

Further, it has also increased its stake in HalaPlay, a real money gaming app.\n\nIn the past, Nazara has acquired NODWIN Gaming, DJuzz and MyGamma and has invested in startups such as MasterMind Sports, BakBuck, Truly Social, InstaSportz, and Moong Labs.\n\nSpeaking about the latest acquisition, Nitish Mittersain founder and MD, Nazara Technologies Ltd. said that Kiddopia will be leveraged to over 100 Mn users through the Nazara network\n\nPaper Boat Apps was founded in 2013 by husband-wife duo, Anupam and Anshu Dhanuka as a boot-strapped startup. In July 2017, Paper Boat Apps launched their flagship app, Kiddopia. The app became an instant hit and reached the #1 rank in the Kids category on the US App Store.\n\nNazara is aggressively expanding in real money skill gaming space and while it has already got a stake in real money fantasy gaming, the quizzing app will give it another revenue channel, especially as quizzing has a broader appeal than fantasy gaming.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Dutch startup Somnox doubled its Kickstarter goal for the world’s first sleep robot.\n\nOn November 14th, 2017, soft robotics startup Somnox launched its Kickstarter campaign to launch the world’s first sleep robot. And now, one month later, Somnox has raised a total amount of €200.274 from 509 backers, doubling its initial goal. Due to this success, Somnox will start production, aiming to help 100.000 people achieve a good night’s rest in 2025. We talked to Julian Jagtenberg, founder of Dutch startup Somnox, on how his project came to life.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nThe early beginnings\n\nThe company didn’t actually start as a startup. Jagtenberg: “Somnox is basically a school project that got totally out of hand. It started as a soft robotics project during my studies at the Technical University of Delft. It was my aim to create a huggable companion robot to fight insomnia. I already had known about the problem for some time, because some of my own friends and family members had told me about it. At the time, you could only combat insomnia with medical treatment, so I wanted to provide an alternative. ”\n\nScientific background\n\nAccording to Jagtenberg, many studies have shown that feeling a breathing rhythm can reduce stress and induce sleep. A particular bit of research was done by Novosad and colleagues. They concluded that infants sleeping with a Breathing Bear showed neurobehavioral benefits and had a less negative temperament. Another, more recent study, showed how the combination of cognitive behavioral intervention (a form of therapy for depression) and certain breathing exercises could improve the sleep of patients with depression. Concluding, you could say that a good breathing rhythm is really important to be able to relax.\n\nThe ultimate sleep companion\n\nThe sleep robot is meant to be the ultimate sleep companion. When holding it, you will feel it breathe, effectively relaxing the body and the mind. By synchronizing your breathing rhythm to that of Somnox you will reach a steady and slower breathing rhythm. And because this kind of deep breathing sends a message to the brain to relax the body, it’s one of the best ways to lower stress. This surely seems to be the case, as, after all, not many school projects reach global markets.\n\nA good match\n\nAnother influential factor to Somnox’s promising future is its co-operation with Auping. The company is the leading circular bed and mattresses manufacturer in Europe, being able to manufacture and sell products on an international scale. The two companies initially started working together based on their intrinsic motivation for good sleep and innovation. Jagtenberg: “Auping also has a mission to let people sleep better, so a potential collaboration made total sense. Auping wanted to do more than just create the best beds and mattresses, so they expanded and stumbled upon us. They will take care of the production of our sleeping robot, making use of their product partners. Eventually, the robot will be sold through Auping’s network as well.”\n\nDelivering a high quality product\n\nSomnox seems to have a promising future ahead of it. Jagtenberg stated the following on their future goals: “Our first priority is producing and delivering a high quality product. With the financial support we received as a result of the Kickstarter, this can be easily achieved. A lot of startups actually struggle with the initial delivery of their products. Auping is going to be a big help as well to get the product to our customers. Most importantly, however, we have got a lot of good and passionate people that are working very hard to get the product to the market. Eventually, we will try expanding to the American market as well, since the potential there is very high. For now though, we will focus on the Dutch and European market.”\n\nThe ultimate goal\n\nJagtenberg: “Eventually, we want to offer the substitute to sleeping pills. Regarding competition, we think it is a good thing to have a lot of different players in the same market. No one can provide a solution to the whole problem.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg for this global VC. Antler’s goal is to generate a total of 100 to 150 new startups around the world by the end of the year.\n\nSince the end of 2018, the startup generator and early-stage VC has invested €5.4 million into launching 44 global startups. After receiving 13,000 applications for its programme, Antler selected over 450 individuals to participate and become startup founders.\n\nSince launching its first program in Singapore in 2018, Antler has expanded to eight locations, including Stockholm, New York, London, Amsterdam, Oslo, Sydney, Nairobi, and Addis Ababa. Two programmes take place annually in each city, and in the first phase successful startups receive $100k to $150k in funding from Antler for a minority equity stake. Startups leverage Antler’s global platform to expand and easily scale into other markets.\n\nAspiring entrepreneurs can apply now to join cohorts in Amsterdam, London, Oslo, Stockholm, Singapore, Sydney, New York and Nairobi.\n\n“In just six months, Antler has enabled hundreds of entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds to create outstanding companies that are already positively impacting global and local economies with the next wave of technology,” said Magnus Grimeland, founder and CEO of Antler. “What can take a young startup months and years to accomplish in a new market we can accelerate significantly with our experienced team and advisers. We are well on our way to becoming the number one platform for entrepreneurs globally by becoming a truly global company ourselves, however, our journey is only just beginning.”\n\nAntler’s successful startups now operate across 15 different industries including fintech, spacetech, robotics, and health tech. Here are some exciting examples of the startup’s Antler has funded so far:\n\nSkyQraft, a system providing affordable and safe infrastructure inspections using drones and AI to detect risks to power lines. These risks are increasing because of the impact of global warming which has resulted in more forest fires and power outages around the world.\n\nSampingan, a task-based workforce platform connecting organizations with freelance employees in Indonesia. The startup recently secured $500k from Golden Gate Ventures. Since it was founded, the company has on-boarded 20,000 agents across 140,000 projects. As well, in seven months, the company’s value has gone up ten times.\n\nSoma Sketch, a health tech app that allows patients to communicate mental and physical health symptoms by writing and drawing how their body feels. The app will help identify risks, educate users on their health and generate anonymous data for research.\n\nOne of Antler’s key missions is to break the barriers to entrepreneurship. Antler’s founders range from Cambridge graduates to self-made geniuses because, rather than focusing on individuals’ backgrounds, the team looks for applicants with spike, inner-drive and grit. With programmes operating across five continents, Antler has already attracted an incredibly diverse range of people, with founding teams comprising over 50 nationalities.

{"text": "British Company Launches World-changing Battery Technology.\n\nA British Power Revolution\n\nE-Getx Limited, trading as ConFlow Power, formally launches a low cost, environmentally benign, solid state battery/generator.\n\nDrawing on such diverse disciplines as mechanical engineering, electrochemistry and energetics, the company has developed a device that produces a constant flow of energy. Unlike a traditional battery, it doesn't store energy so much as harvest it, capturing electrons from the surrounding air. The result is limitless power.\n\nThe device has undergone thousands of hours of testing, cumulating in intensive testing within the last sixty days. Observers report irrespective of how many times the device was discharged, it never failed to recharge itself.\n\nThe product is now ready for commercialization. All parties involved have agreed on the steps that need to be taken to bring the product to market in a timely manner. And avoid the mistakes that have been made by others in the past.\n\nThe British and Battery Energy\n\nIn 1980, John Goodenough discovered lithium cobalt oxide and invented the technology for lithium-ion batteries. The battery has driven much of the enormous technological advancement in the late 20th and early 21st Century; without it, there would be no Apple, no Tesla. But back in the eighties, Sony commercialised the technology, and the UK saw very little direct commercial benefit. This trend continues today, in the race for dominance in the electric vehicle market. The Telegraph, for which Boris Johnson is a columnist, said in May, \"the UK is still very much in the slow lane in the race for next generation automotive technology.\"\n\nThe British Government in 2019\n\nFollowing significant investment in development of electric cars since 2011, in 2017 the UK government announced an investment of £246 million into battery research, and creation of the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre in Coventry. The government has also spent £400 million on electric car charging infrastructure and announced support for further development of electric cars at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK's largest car manufacturer.\n\nThe Future is Here\n\nForty years after his discovery, and at the age of 97, John Goodenough isn't finished. He is working on a super-battery, one that will make electric cars competitive with combustion, and that will economically store wind and solar power.\n\nBut the path he has chosen involves one of the toughest problems in battery science, which is how to make an anode out of pure lithium or sodium metal. If it can be done, the resulting battery would have 60% more energy than current lithium-ion cells. Over the years, numerous scientists have tried and failed—it was lithium metal, for instance, that kept setting Stan Whittingham's lab on fire at Exxon in the 1970s.\n\nAlthough Goodenough will not spell out his precise new idea, he thinks he is on to something. And, because of his record, the field knows that anyone would be foolhardy to bet against him. \"He's very astute still. His mind is still cranking away,\" says Thackeray, the South African who invented manganese spinel under Goodenough, and now is at the US's Argonne National Laboratory. \"If there is going to be a breakthrough, it will come from left-field. And John comes from outside the box.\"\n\nOutside the Box… in Britain\n\nConFlow's continuous flow solution to the battery conundrum confirms Thackeray's belief. However, the solution doesn't involve lithium, and is inexpensive and inexhaustible. It avails itself of the latest findings in Nano-technology and results in a battery/generator-like device that is self-renewing.\n\nLeft field. Out of the box. And British.\n\nAnd this time, the infrastructure is in place to ensure success, through government support for the market, and a new financial investment model.\n\nA British Financial Revolution\n\nIt's wholly appropriate that such a unique and revolutionary technology should be launching on a new and revolutionary financial platform.\n\nDuring the testing period, ConFlow's inventor and his team have been working closely with ILOCX, addressing questions and providing information that has allowed ConFlow's management to conclude that the device actually works and has the potential to change the way power is generated and distributed.\n\nILOCX is a British-based platform that allows companies to raise non-equity capital through the sale of Initial License Offerings (\"ILOs\"). This is a new and unique revenue-based method to raise capital, promote and sell products and services, and to receive royalties based on a company's gross revenue.\n\nILOCX has funded all 40 companies so far that have listed via its PreILO platform, and has 28 companies on its main board, offering some $300 million in transactions. In addition, ILOCX has a Crypto Currency platform at www.ILOcrypto.com that accepts most recognised Crypto Currency or ALT coins as payment for an ILO.\n\nILOCX facilitates ConFlow Power's growth strategy, which is based on fast, safe and secure delivery and application of its unique technology, potentially resulting in market domination.\n\nAs part of an earlier acquisition of the technology, IP and patents, \"E-Getx Limited\" and ILOCX entered into an agreement to accelerate the ConFlow Power device to market using a combination of underwriting, acquisition and strategy. This includes a rigorous schedule for continued testing, databasing and regulating the ConFlow Power technology, making it fully ready for market.\n\nConFlow Power's listing on PreILO is a stepping stone to the next level. PreILO speeds the company into revenue-ready status. Then, as agreed upon, the company will elevate its listing to the main ILOCX board.\n\nConFlow Power has developed a battery/generator that enlists various advanced technologies to capture electrons from the ambient air, to create a totally self-renewing power source; the name ConFlow representing a 'Continuous Flow'. ConFlow Power closely resembles a solid-state battery in terms of size and design, however, it performs like an electrical generator…without the moving parts associated with a generator. The ConFlow Battery/Generator meets a wide variety of applications to in such diverse fields as tele-communications, transportation, emergency power, heating/cooling, construction, medical science and personal electronics. It also has implications for heavy industry.\n\nConFlow Power intends to use GCLs (Global Conditional Licensing) to hasten introduction and adoption of its technology. Licensees will have a wide footprint and a strong presence in a particular market segment.\n\nThe ILOCX is the Initial License Offering Contract Exchange, a platform where innovative companies can list License Offerings. Buyers of these licenses agree to participate in the company's growth by promoting them on social media all the way to becoming an affiliate. ILOs are a truly Collaborative Capital partnership blending a Collaborative Marketing concept that reaches more people than is possible under any other method. Unique marketing campaigns are generated by 1000s of ILOers that by nature must reach more niche groups, as they themselves are niche. The ILO structure, created by ILOCX, completely bridges the gap between Capital and Company. There is no one else involved. ILOs are licensing contracts that permit the ILOer to promote the company's approved information to a wide audience for the purpose of perpetuating sales. This system drives sales revenue and then rewards it on both sides. ILOers get a percentage of the company's gross revenue, similar to a commission, for their promoting activity. This lasts for a 3-year term, after which the company elects to either roll the license again, buy it back, or convert it to equity in the case of a stock market listing.\n\nSOURCE ILOCX", "entities": []}

The company has already invested $92.9 Mn (INR 600 Cr) in EVs in the last five to six years.\n\nThe country’s first electric vehicle manufacturer said that the investments will be used to increase production capacity and improve its technology and products.\n\nAddressing the media during Magnetic Maharashtra, Pawan Goenka, MD of Mahindra Group, said, “We are not waiting for any policy to move forward. To be a pioneer, you have to create the road and we have to move forward.”\n\nGoenka further informed that Mahindra’s current EV manufacturing capacity is 400 units in a month, which he expects will cross 1500 this September. Mahindra has set an ambitious target of rolling out 4000 units by December 2019. Also, with this investment, the company is targeting the capacity to build 5000 units a month.\n\nFurthermore, the Mumbai-headquartered company will be looking to manufacture all components of the EVs, except batteries. He clarified that batteries require greater volumes for local manufacturing and therefore, will have to be imported.\n\nTerming the investment a “leap of faith”, Goenka added that the present demand for EVs is 300 units a month.\n\nGovernment’s U-turn on EV policy\n\nNitin Gadkari, Minister for Road and Transport, had recently announced that there is no need for an EV policy in the country now. He also added that no further incentives will be accorded to the industry other than the existing ones. The announcement caused ripples in the auto industry.\n\nFollowing this, lobby group Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) decided to meet Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog and Heavy Industries Minister Anant Geete to seek clarity on the government’s position on EV policy in India. The group believes that the current subsidy on electric two-wheelers is not significant enough to lure buyers.\n\nHowever, Goenka supports the government’s announcement saying that there has been no u-turn by the government, as it already offers benefits in GST treatment. More so, EV policies of respective states can keep the industry going.\n\nHe also clarified that government’s earlier plan of turning 100% electric by 2030 was “too ambitious”. He added, “we should be satisfied if we achieve 30% EV share by 2030.”\n\nGoenka also pointed out that the biggest hindrance for EV- makers is the lack of charging infrastructure. He suggested that transport aggregators including Ola and Uber will be the first ones to adopt EVs.\n\nHe also emphasised that EV space is a huge opportunity and that everyone should focus on it. He further expects the industry to continue its growth at 4-5% even in the decade to the 2030s.\n\nGrowth Of EVs In India\n\nIn the recently concluded Auto Expo 2018, auto industry showcased 28 market ready EV products. The event witnessed Indian and global automobile companies joining the EV bandwagon, including Renault, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Mahindra.\n\nMahindra Group showcased a range of EVs, including a bus called e-COSMO and a lithium-ion battery-powered three-wheeler called Treo.\n\nCommercial vehicles manufacturer Ashok Leyland launched its first electric bus, called Circuit S. On the other hand, Maruti Suzuki unveiled the first design concept of its electric vehicle, e-Survivor.\n\nHowever, global companies showed reluctance in launching their products in India at present as they await a policy framework. However, with the launches of EVs, the country is also addressing the issue of charging stations.\n\nRecently, Exicom installed the first electric vehicle charging station at United Nation office in Lodhi Estate. Also, Menza Motors, an EV Startup set up three charging stations along the Yamuna Expressway.\n\nThe electric vehicles (EV) market is expected to record double-digit growth rates with the rise in sales volume annually in India till 2020, according to ASSOCHAM-EY joint study.\n\nThe study titled ‘Electric mobility in India: Leveraging collaboration and nascency’, further said that despite electric vehicles not being mainstream, stricter emission norms, reducing battery prices and increasing consumer awareness are driving EV adoption in India.\n\nA recent report by FICCI and Rocky Mountain Institute said that if successful, the shift to electric vehicles could potentially help India save up to $300 Bn (INR 20 Lakh Cr) in oil imports and nearly 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.\n\nWith increasing push towards electric vehicles segment, the latest investment by Mahindra Group is sure to boost the confidence of players in the industry.", "entities": []}

The system has been proven to dramatically increase the number of lungs available for transplant from the current donor pool and, when commercialized globally, has the potential to help tens of thousands of additional patients around the world.\n\n“The technology behind XOR’s system has a long track record of clinical success. Over the past six years it has been used more than 200 times at UHN, approved by Health Canada, and clinical results using the technology have been extensively published, including in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine,” said Shaf Keshavjee, MD, one the founders of XOR and a globally recognized lung researcher and transplant surgeon at UHN. “XOR’s system will be a game-changer, since it will enable clinicians all around the world to use advanced techniques developed and perfected in Toronto, including gene and stem cell therapy, to make more lungs available for transplant and to make the transplanted lungs even better than the ones available today. All of this will improve patient care and reduce transplant waiting lists.”\n\n“The XOR team has most certainly transformed the lung-transplant world. By developing a platform to allow personalized medicine for the organs themselves, they will also affect the treatment of numerous diseases of lungs and other organs. Given XENiOS’s focus on cutting-edge lung-and-heart-assist therapies and immediate commercial reach, partnering with XOR is a very positive addition to our product family,” added Georg Matheis, MD, Managing Director and Founder of XENiOS.\n\nGlobally there are approximately one million patients who could potentially benefit from a lung transplant due to diseases such as Pulmonary Fibrosis, Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Unfortunately, at present, fewer than 6,000 procedures are performed each year due to the limited availability of quality lungs, which means that less than 1 percent of patients are being helped and, of those listed for transplant, 20 percent will die waiting for a suitable donor organ. The partnership between XENiOS and XOR-Labs is expected to offer new hope for the thousands of patients in need of a lung transplant.\n\nAbout XOR-Labs Toronto\n\nXOR-Labs is a cutting-edge medical device company focused on leading dramatic advances within the fields of organ transplantation and diseased organ treatment. XOR’s ultimate goal is to become the worldwide leader in advanced multi-organ therapies, a market conservatively valued at $3-$5 billion.\n\nAbout XENiOS®\n\nXENiOS AG is a privately held medical device company. XENiOS® is the therapy and technology leader in minimally invasive lung-and-heart assist. Its novalung®, i–cor®, and medos® devices provide pulmonary and cardiac assist for a broad range of support levels, and all run on the XENiOS® console. The XENiOS® products are designed to provide at least four essential advantages with its minimally invasive lung and heart therapies: (1) patients can be awake and mobile;(2) self-actuated patients facilitate improved outcomes; (3) there is no ventilator-associated lung injury or pneumonia; (4) additionally, the XENiOS® platform creates a physiologic natural pulse designed to protect the heart.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160222005397/en/\n\nFor XENIOS®\n\nRonald Trahan Associates\n\nRonald Trahan, APR, +1-508-359-4005, ext. 108\n\nor\n\nXOR Labs\n\nJon Rogers\n\nCOO\n\njon.rogers@xorlabstoronto.com", "entities": [[0, 7, "investor"], [16, 28, "money_funded"], [32, 48, "org_in_focus"], [183, 211, "headquarters_loc"], [228, 245, "date_of_funding"], [248, 255, "investor"], [310, 315, "date_of_funding"], [332, 344, "money_funded"], [348, 364, "org_in_focus"], [367, 370, "org_in_focus"]]}

Mate Rimac, the founder of Rimac Automobili, gave this statement during the opening of the Cisco Connect Conference on April 7. Apparently, due to the upcoming second round of investment, Rimac might be obliged to transfer the main offices of the company to a country where investors feel more secure working under familiar laws.\n\nAccording to the official statement, Rimac made for ICT Business, the company is currently expecting a much bigger amount of funding which might also be accompanied by a direct request from investors to move abroad. This wouldn’t be the first time that a startup company is required to move its headquarters in order to receive the necessary investment. Bellabeat and Farmeron, the two Croatian startups that also had to move abroad for the same reason, are the examples Rimac referred to when making his point. The company has already put great efforts to delay the need to leave Zagreb during the first round of investment that amounted to EUR 10 million, as reported by ICT Business. However, the amount of the second investment is assumed to be much larger, which would make resistance to such request rather impossible.\n\nMate Rimac has also refined his statement on one of his social network profiles after realizing many media have misinterpreted his initial statement. As he puts it in the direct statement addressing the public, he will give his best to keep the headquarters of the company in Zagreb, where it currently is.

Selected from among the available Hadoop distributions, MapR has no single point of failure(*2) and is the most suitable platform for enterprise use. To further boost efficiency, the Asakusa Framework(*3) is being used for batch processing development and deployment on MapR.\n\nBy virtue of this new parallel distributed processing technology, the MapR-based system achieves processing times 15X those of conventional systems. Increases in the amount and data and processing performed can also be achieved by simply adding server nodes, which promises to reduce TCO and enhance ROI over the medium/long term.\n\nAbout MapR Converged Data Platform\n\nThe MapR Converged Data Platform maximizes use of cost-effective commodity hardware while also providing the uptimes and reliability needed by cloud systems as well as a path to the latest data services architecture. The MapR Platform also provides excellent data management capabilities in exabyte-scale environments.\n\nThe MapR Converged Data Platform provides high-speed access to files, database tables, and data streams using its proprietary technology. It also offers accessibility, security, high availability, disaster recovery, data protection, and provides an open environment conforming to NFS and POSIX for ease of use in enterprise IT environments. It delivers distributed processing capabilities and extremely high scalability and performance in cloud and on-premise environments as well as in environments spanning both.\n\n*1 ALM (asset-liability management) is a method of managing financial risk that involves comprehensive management of assets and liabilities. ALM is the method of (or general term for) risk management mainly used by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies.\n\n*2 Hadoop’s single point of failure, on both Apache Hadoop and commercial Hadoop distributions based on it, is NameNode. The problem is that if a NameNode becomes unavailable, the entire system stops. MapR resolves this by providing NameNode redundancy.\n\n*3 The Asakusa Framework(TM) is a framework for large-scale core batch processing on Hadoop.\n\nAbout MapR Technologies\n\nHeadquartered in San Jose, Calif., MapR provides the industry’s only Converged Data Platform that enables customers to harness the power of big data by combining analytics in real-time to operational applications to improve business outcomes.

This is a social experiment, which uses blockchain to give consumers the right to choose if they want to give back to the farmers or use it to get a discount on their next purchase.\n\n10 winning deep tech scaleups of 2019 Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Take a look at winners of EIT Digital Challenge 2019. Show Less\n\nThe idea behind this experimental chocolate bar comes from FairChain Foundation in collaboration with the UN and is powered by Guido van Staveren, founder of the Moyee Coffee. The idea is to bring about products into elements of change by providing customers a chance to take part in the transition themselves instead of trusting third-party’s, including NGOs.\n\nThe Other Bar touted to bring radical quality is not the first blockchain pilot taken by FairChain Foundation. Back in 2018, the company joined hands with Moyee Coffee to run a similar initiative to ensure fairer business for Ethiopian coffee farmers.\n\nNecessity for a fairer system\n\nNotably, it is touted that a majority of cocoa farmers gain as low as 3% of the value of the cocoa used to make chocolate sold in shops. Moreover, the cocoa market price crashed between late 2016 and early 2017, thereby making farmers experience only a fraction of their income, which is up to 40%. And, this led to issues such as deforestation and child labour. It is important to bring a fairer system to continue to enjoy great chocolate.\n\nIn addition to paying farmers a fairer price for the cocoa, this social experience dubbed The Other Bar is meant to improve economic impact. The experiment will plant more trees to ensure a sustainable future income, and this will increase the future crop yields of cocoa farmers with new trees and in-pack tokens.\n\nLimited edition stock!\n\nWell, The Other Bar, the blockchain-powered chocolate bar, will be available for purchase from today. Initially, there will be a limited run of 20,000 bars, and each pack will have a QR code token with a value, which is equivalent to a quarter of a cocoa tree. The Other Bar is made from organic Ecuadorian cocoa and will be available in both dark and milk chocolate. The pack contains two 50g bars and is priced at €3.4.\n\nIf consumers choose to return this value back to the cocoa farmers, there will be a fairer community of farmers in the future. Also, there is an option for customers to get nearly €0.30 profit on their next purchase. If all consumers decide to let go of their discount for the welfare of cocoa farmers, then the first stock of 20,000 bars will fetch an amount that will let farmers grow 5,000 cocoa trees and an additional income for farmers every year for another 15 years.\n\nMain image picture credits: The Only Bar\n\nStay tuned to Silicon Canals for more European technology news.\n\nAlso read,", "entities": []}

No financial terms were disclosed for the transaction that was done in partnership with Redwood management and unnamed co-investors. Also, Redwood has made three add-on acquisitions: Signature Smiles, Affordable Dental Care and Holly Dental Care.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nEvanston, IL, July 19, 2017 – Silver Oak Services Partners, LLC (“Silver Oak”), a lower middle market private equity firm focused exclusively on service businesses, announced it has led the recapitalization of Redwood Dental (“Redwood”) in partnership with management and co-investors. In conjunction with the recapitalization, Redwood completed the add-on acquisitions of Signature Smiles, Affordable Dental Care, and Holly Dental Care (collectively, the practices are referred to as the “Company”).\n\nFounded in 1982, Redwood is a leading provider of general and specialty dentistry services in Detroit, MI, operating eight locations throughout the Detroit metropolitan area. The acquisitions of Signature Smiles and Affordable Dental Care add two additional dental practices operating out of single location to Redwood’s platform, and the acquisition of Holly Dental Care adds a tenth location.\n\n“We are proud to announce our growth investment from Silver Oak, as well as the addition of three dental practices to our platform. We believe our partnership with Silver Oak will significantly enhance our growth trajectory going forward,” said Dr. Mark Bouchillon, President of Redwood. Dr. Bouchillon will remain a part of the executive team at Redwood, and Dr. Jeff Solomon, previous CEO of Signature Smiles and Affordable Dental Care, will become CEO of the Company.\n\n“We are excited about our partnership with Silver Oak. Silver Oak’s experience in growing center-based healthcare services businesses made them ideal partners for us, and they bring the additional capital resources and expertise we need to significantly grow the Company,” said Dr. Jeff Solomon. The Redwood management team will retain significant ownership stakes in the business.\n\nSilver Oak was attracted to dental services as a compelling sector for investment due to the recession-resistant nature of the sector, high fragmentation of the industry, low level of capital intensity and the availability of acquisition targets at reasonable multiples. Dan Gill, Managing Partner at Silver Oak, said, “We are excited to partner with Dr. Bouchillon, Dr. Solomon and the rest of the team at Redwood. Redwood is well-known in the industry for its high-quality patient care, and we believe Redwood has developed a best-in-class platform from which to grow.” Redwood is actively looking for add-on acquisition opportunities.\n\nPlease contact Dan Gill or David Friedman of Silver Oak for additional information.\n\nSilver Oak invests in business, consumer and healthcare services companies in the lower middle market, typically with EBITDA of $4 million to $20 million.", "entities": [[0, 10, "investor"], [17, 22, "type_of_funding"], [26, 40, "org_in_focus"], [43, 75, "investor"], [86, 102, "type_of_funding"], [106, 120, "org_in_focus"], [124, 131, "headquarters_loc"], [455, 467, "headquarters_loc"], [469, 482, "date_of_funding"], [485, 518, "investor"], [645, 661, "type_of_funding"], [665, 679, "org_in_focus"], [682, 689, "org_in_focus"], [968, 972, "year_founded"], [974, 981, "org_in_focus"], [1051, 1062, "headquarters_loc"]]}

{"text": "A new paradigm for scaling early stage impact investing in SA.\n\nThe world is facing diminishing natural resources, a growing population and an increasing economic inequality. But impact investing can help solve these issues.\n\nImpact investing seeks to create both a financial return, alongside a positive social or environmental impact.\n\nAs governments and civil society struggle to achieve the UN’s Social Development Goals (SDGs), the trillions of dollars in the financial system, could be put to better use, in the hands of capable entrepreneurs, trying to solve these issues.\n\nIn addition, early stage impact investing, geared towards small growing businesses (SGBs), has the potential of providing funding to the “missing middle”, ie companies with capital requirements, that are too big for micro finance, angel investors and grant funders, but too small for private equity, or too risky for traditional debt funders.\n\nThese SGBs are critical growth drivers of the economy, not only in terms of job creation, but also in terms of positively impacting rising inequality, spiraling social issues (like health, education, energy, water and food security) and the increasing effects of climate change.\n\nIn South Africa, there are only a limited number of players, in this ecosystem. At an event in January hosted by the Impact Amplifier and Edge Growth discussions were held on three key areas, which require focus from all early stage impact investing ecosystem participants, to catalyse improved funding and performance.\n\nThe forum was fortunate to include partners from Capria (a global accelerator for emerging market impact investing fund managers) who provided valuable learnings and insights from their experience in early stage impact investing across several emerging markets.\n\nThe three required focus areas discussed include:\n\n1. Create an investor community – By engaging downstream funders\n\nInvestors are encouraged to engage extensively, with next stage funders, to better understand their investment appetite and key decision-making criteria before making investments.\n\nThis will optimally position SGB investments for follow-on funding or exits, mitigate liquidity risk and potentially crowd in more capital into this space.\n\nBy working together with different ecosystem funders and actors, it will reduce the risk profile, mature the market, and potentially enhance returns.\n\n2. Disrupt the traditional fund management model – Investing early stage is not cheap\n\nWhen investing into SGBs, fund sizes are smaller than private equity structures and require additional resource intensive pre-and- post investment support.\n\nThis means that traditional private equity business models, simply do not work for early-stage investing.\n\nCapital providers that want to invest in these exciting missing middle funds, should consider the actual effort it takes to make early stage deals work, and allow for higher overall average fees, to enable the best possible value creation and net fund returns.\n\n3. Tighten up the system – Bring more venture capital rigor and discipline into early stage impact investing\n\nGiven the requirement for financial and social or environmental impact, the investment process should be even more rigorous and disciplined, in early stage impact investing than traditional venture capital or private equity investments.\n\nFund managers should implement global best practice in deal-sourcing, investment analysis, selection criteria processes and impact measurement and reporting.\n\nHigh quality investment committee advisors are also required to enhance the process, and ensure that all aspects of the investments are considered.\n\nWhy is it important for the ecosystem as a whole to pull in the same direction?\n\nSimply put, success breeds success, and there is still very little evidence in South Africa, to date.\n\nNoteworthy performance from a variety of local participants, is the best way to create significant momentum, and attract additional capital, particularly from the more commercially driven investors, such as pension funds and retail asset managers, into this essential SGB asset class.\n\nEarly stage impact investing has the potential to address some fundamental social and environmental challenges at scale, however given the complex and nascent industry, a collaborative ecosystem approach will be a key success factor!\n\n*Janice Johnston is investment head at Edge Growth. Edge Growth provides funding for high-growth SMEs.\n\nThis piece was co-written with Max Pichulik, a partner at Impact Amplifier which supports high-growth impact businesses to access funding from both local and international investors.\n\nFeatured image: geralt via Pixabay", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alberta commits $100 million to AI companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Alberta government announced a $100 million investment, over a period of five years, to attract more artificial intelligence-based high-tech companies to Alberta.\n\nThe five-year plan will support both Alberta Innovates and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) to leverage partnerships with Alberta’s research universities, while also creating jobs. In addition, Alberta will undertake a significant campaign to market Alberta’s tech talent to the world in order to attract new investment. Since 2002, Alberta has invested $42 million in AI research at the University of Alberta and Amii.\n\n“Businesses around the world are turning to machine learning and artificial intelligence as key drivers of innovation across every industry sector.”\n\nAn initial investment of $27 million will go to Edmonton-based Amii. This, coupled with the federal government’s $25 million investment, will help the non-profit develop a new program that supports companies looking to build in-house AI capacity, as well as establish a new office in Calgary.\n\n“Businesses around the world are turning to machine learning and artificial intelligence as key drivers of innovation across every industry sector,” John Shillington, CEO of Amii said. “With this renewed support from the Government of Alberta, Amii will advance transformational business programs offering scientific mentorship and educational opportunities.”\n\nThe government predicts the investment will result in about 5,600 new jobs, the creation of 140 new companies, and $1.5 billion in value to Alberta businesses and Amii-affiliated startups. The Government of Alberta said it expects over $207 million in leveraged investments by the industry as well.\n\nLast year, Alberta also invested $50 million to create 3,000 high-tech training seats at post-secondary schools. In 2018, University of Alberta researchers were ranked third in the world for research in AI and machine learning by CSRankings.\n\nRachel Notley, Alberta’s premier, said that Alberta needs to diversify beyond its energy sector. “Innovation is a critical tool for competitiveness in nearly every sector of the economy, including energy,” Notley said. “By investing in technology and the talent that powers it, we are ensuring Alberta continues to be a world leader in clean, efficient energy production and that our economy is more resilient and diversified for the future.”\n\nNotley adds that, without long-term commitment and investment for a diversified future, Alberta is at risk of losing its competitive advantage to the “Ontarios and Quebecs” of the world. “That’s not a thing we want to see happen,” she stated.\n\nFeatured image courtesy the Government of Alberta.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Vietnam’s B2B e-commerce startup Telio banks $25m Series A.\n\nTelio, which claims to be Vietnam’s first B2B e-commerce platform, has raised $25 million in a Series A round led by Tiger Global, according to an official announcement.\n\nDealStreetAsia had reported the Tiger Global-led financing in October.\n\nThe funding round was joined by Sequoia India, GGV Capital and RTP Global.\n\nTelio had previously secured seed funding from Surge, the accelerator programme by Sequoia Capital, as one of the 17 startups in its inaugural cohort.\n\nThe valuation of Telio after the latest round could not be verified but the startup claims a 10x jump in its value from its seed round. The Vietnamese company also claims to have increased its annual gross merchandise value (GMV) more than 50 times since its Surge days.\n\nThe company, founded in November 2018, connects small mom-and-pop stores with brands and wholesalers on its platform and claims to offer better pricing and more efficient logistics.\n\nSmall retailers accounted for over 60 per cent of fast-moving consumer goods sales in urban areas and over 90 per cent in rural Vietnam, according to research firm Kantar. However, they still remain underserved by modern technology solutions.\n\nTelio’s smartphone app tackles the time and access issue which mom-and-pop shops typically need to call 50-80 wholesalers and distributors to place individual orders, which can take up to a week to arrive. The startup said it is now building a network of warehouses to ensure next-day delivery.\n\nTelio currently has over 3,000 retailers from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City on its platform, having enjoyed a 70 per cent month-on-month growth over the past eight months. These retailers are placing an average of seven orders per month with Telio.\n\nThe company expects to expand to four more cities and onboard 15,000 retailers by June 2020, as well as expand to several new verticals in the next few months.\n\n“Our mission is to empower the large population of small retailers in Vietnam, who play an important role in our economy and the local neighbourhoods they serve. The inventory supply chain in our country is very fragmented, and these small retailers don’t have a clear view of pricing, quality and even availability of most products,” said Telio founder and CEO Bui Sy Phong.\n\nPhong said he came up with the idea to establish Telio after he joined Alibaba’s eFounders programme in 2018, realising he wanted to do something to serve small businesses that are the backbone of the national economy.\n\n“We found out that cashless payments isn’t one of the main pain points of the mom-and-pop stores. However… fulfilling their stores is a pain point where we can help,” My Linh, head of strategy at Telio, said in a recent GGV Capital podcast.\n\n“Mom-and-pop shops form the lifeblood of Vietnamese consumption and have historically been durable against the expansion of modern retail and e-commerce,” said Jixun Foo, managing partner at GGV Capital.\n\n“By leveraging technology, Telio can tap into the microentrepreneurs’ knowledge of their catchment area and their community-level efficient scale to unlock their true potential and empower the community,” he added.\n\nVietnam is one of the two pacesetters in Southeast Asia – the other being Indonesia – in terms of its internet economy, which is growing in excess of 40 per cent a year, according to the e-Conomy SEA 2019 report by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain.\n\nDriven by impressive e-commerce growth, the country’s internet economy is slated to touch $12 billion in 2019, with its gross merchandise value set to account for over 5 per cent of the country’s GDP, per the report.", "entities": [[0, 7, "headquarters_loc"], [33, 38, "org_in_focus"], [45, 49, "money_funded"], [50, 58, "type_of_funding"], [61, 66, "org_in_focus"], [87, 94, "headquarters_loc"], [139, 150, "money_funded"], [156, 164, "type_of_funding"], [178, 190, "investor"], [264, 276, "investor"], [294, 301, "date_of_funding"], [336, 349, "investor"], [351, 362, "investor"], [367, 377, "investor"], [837, 841, "year_founded"]]}

{"text": "Austrian Zerolens raises €235K to further develop and launch their product on the market.\n\nAustrian software startup Zerolens raised 235.000 euros from both, the Austrian VC Speedinvest and the Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (AWS) – the Austrian federal development and financing bank for the promotion and financing of companies, Austrian media reported. Reportedly, the money will help the startup to further develop and launch its product on the market. The team wants to work on the further development of the software and increase the team from three to five members.\n\n“The €235,000 is a mixture of promotion and cash investment and enables the development of the software as well as the initial market entry”, says Lukas Fechtig, one of the founder of the startup, Wirtschafts Zait, reported.\n\nFounded in March 2019 by Lukas Fechtig, Mirko Vodegel and Nik Redel, Zerolens is a virtual photo studio app that helps companies and creatives to easily create pictures for their marketing activities. Reportedly the young company Zerolens has set itself the task of making it easy for companies to create images for marketing purposes. This works with a web and mobile app where customers can independently shoot photos in virtual photo studios. With just a few clicks, realistic product photos can be generated directly from the laptop or mobile phone.\n\n“At the moment we are working on further developing the tool with beta customers and integrating new features and virtual photo sets. The focus is on companies with a high demand for social media content”, Fechtig added.\n\nAs reported in the media, the idea for this startup was born during the time when their founders worked in an online jewelry shop. Reportedly while working there the founders Lukas Fechtig and Nikolaus Redl were confronted with one problem: producing professional product photos was very time-consuming and expensive – especially for products that are in an extraordinary and difficult to reach the environment, such as a tropical beach, had to be photographed. To solve the problem, Fechtig and Redl worked with another co-founder, Mirko Vodegel, on a technical solution to save both a professional photo studio and an expensive photographer or travel expenses.\n\nIn order to be able to photograph the objects from different perspectives in the virtual environment, they must first be modeled in a CAD program by a 3D artist, Fechtig explains. As another method, he added, photogrammetry can also be used. As Fechtig explains, the object is photographed with around 50 cameras 360 degrees from all sides and then rendered.\n\nIn the future, with the help of this app, visual content (images, videos, AR, VR) can be generated from realistic 3D objects. In the long term, according to Zerolens’ team, this technology, which until now has mainly been familiar from Hollywood, will replace the classic image material.\n\nSpeedinvest is a European venture capital fund for tech start-ups. The company collaborates with entrepreneurs in achieving their goal of building great companies. It is involved in early-stage investments and specializes in operational support. Speedinvest partners with a global network, that includes operations in Silicon Valley, to become a key investment and development hub for Europe’s start-up community.\n\nThe Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft (AWS) is an Austrian federal development and financing bank for the promotion and financing of companies. The bank provides around €1 billion (2008) in development aid, mainly as grants, loans and guarantees to finance projects in the value of almost €11 billion (2008). AWS is focused on four different areas: technology and innovation, equity and capital markets, promotion and financing as well as services for research and development management.

{"text": "P2P storage-space platform Sxuirrel secures R2.4m in seed funding.\n\nSA startup Sxuirrel has secured R2.4-million in seed funding from an undisclosed investor.\n\nThe startup — which is based at Stellenbosch incubator Launchlab where founders Michael John Dipppenaar, Henri Bam and Michael Louis developed a peer-to-peer storage and space solution — made the announcement yesterday.\n\nDippenaar, who is also CEO, revealed that the deal — which was signed two weeks ago — had been over three months in the making, after the startup was approached by the investor that took an interest in the “disruptive effects” of the platform, which the three launched last year. Dippenaar declined to name the investor.\n\nThe deal will see the investor — who is said to have interests in storage, logistics and the transport industry — take a minority shareholding in the startup.\n\nDippenaar said the funding would help the startup to expand, cover marketing and operational costs and bank roll product and platform development, adding that the startup has set its sights on “disrupting” storage and long-term parking.\n\nSxuirrel will use the R2.4-million investment towards expansion, marketing, product development and to cover operational costs\n\nAt present the company is partnering with insurance company SureStart which will see the startup offer low premium cover to its clients.\n\nThe idea behind the startup came about in 2015, he said. “We identified the problem first hand as students at Stellenbosch,” he said referring to how he, along with co-founders Henri Bam and Michael Louis, could not find flexible affordable storage.\n\nFollowing the launch last year of a beta version of the app on the Apps Store, the platform today has between 400 and 450 users.\n\nDippenaar said since the launch of the beta version of the app the company has however generated only about R40 000 in revenue — by charging a commission for each transaction it facilitates on the marketplace. He pointed out that fees range from between seven to 15% of the transaction depending on duration and amount charged.\n\nHe said the biggest challenges the business has faced have been to source the right technically-able employees, develop an effective market strategy and get to grips with better time management, as one of the founders is still studying.\n\nLast year the startup won a R20 000 prize at Launchlab’s Ideas Programme and followed it up earlier this year by being selected as one of the six winners of the Attacq Smart Cities Innovation Challenge, winning a share of R100 000 as well as incubation support of up to R80 000 from Launchlab.\n\nRead more: LaunchLab announces Ideas Programme winners\n\nRead more: Here are the six Attacq Smart Cities Innovation Challenge winners\n\nDippenaar said Launchlab has been instrumental in networking and helping the startup acquire customers. “They are great for the early startup phases and during ideation,” he said.\n\nFeatured image: Sxuirrel founding team (from left to right ) — CTO Michael Louis, CEO Michael-John Dippenaar and COO Henri Bam (Supplied)", "entities": [[27, 35, "org_in_focus"], [44, 49, "money_funded"], [53, 57, "type_of_funding"], [68, 70, "headquarters_loc"], [79, 87, "org_in_focus"], [100, 112, "money_funded"], [116, 120, "type_of_funding"], [192, 204, "cumulative"], [1409, 1413, "year_founded"]]}

The partnership aims to start a programme that can help farmers create more value for their crops and foster their socio-economic development.\n\nThe project further looks to bridge across 20 districts of Karnataka, assisting 4.15 lakh farmers and covering 3.4 lakh acres of land.\n\nIt will assist Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and farm managers to advise farmers in following the right package of practices across crops such as paddy, millets, gram and groundnut.\n\nSynergy Between CropIn And Government of Karnataka\n\nKarnataka is the home to highest number of agritech startups in India but agriculture sector’s contribution to the GDP of the state has been declining. The region of Karnataka has been targeted by drought and harsh weather conditions in the past five years.\n\nIn order to combat the situation, the Government of Karnataka will leverage Cropln’s farm management technology solutions to help farmers grow the right crops and adopt smart-farming techniques and practices.\n\nThe Government, along with the focus on increasing per acre yield quantity, is further aiming to help farmers get optimal value for their yield.\n\nThe programme will include Machine learning and AI to help FPOs get insightful data points for making decisions and guiding farmers. The tools provided under this solution will also help farmer organisations to bring consistency, dependability, and sustainability to the agriculture.\n\nCommenting on the recent development, Krishna Kumar, CEO, CropIn, said, “As an Indian Agtech startup, we feel a deep responsibility towards the well-being of the farmer community. This collaboration with Karnataka Government gives us an opportunity to educate, enable and empower farmers.\n\nEarlier, in 2017, CropIn had also formed a similar tie-up with the Department of Horticulture (DOH) in Andhra Pradesh to digitise farms under two Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO) in the districts of Chittoor and Krishna.\n\nMore about CropIn Technology Solutions\n\nLaunched in 2010 by Krishna Kumar, CropIn is basically a Farm Management-Monitoring-Traceability (agriculture data and analytics) business solution provider.\n\nIt provides SaaS-based service to agri-businesses in India and abroad, enabling partners to analyse, interpret and gain real-time insight on crops and farms so as to be able to take corrective measures on time.\n\nThe company currently claims to be working with over 135 clients and 1.6 Mn farmers across 20 countries.\n\nAs Krishna Kumar explained, the CropIn team has identified that the agriculture sector has minimal and outdated technological/digital intervention. The company thus intends to help agribusinesses make informed, data-driven decisions – with technologies such as Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Geo-tagging and Satellite monitoring to interconnect all the stakeholders at different levels of the agriculture ecosystem.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to enable traceability of food and boost the per acre yield value for agribusinesses and farmers through our offerings,” says Krishna Kumar, Founder, CropIn Technologies.\n\nAccording to Inc42 DataLabs report, around $36 Mn was invested in 15 agritech startups in 2017.

{"text": "Join Crowd2Fund – the automated platform that allows businesses to raise funding from the crowd (Sponsored).\n\nCrowd2Fund is is an automated peer-to-peer investment platform that allows businesses to raise capital from the general public.\n\nUnlike many of the other crowdfunding platforms Crowd2Fund is fully regulated and also gives UK-based investors an additional tax break when they lend to businesses through a financial product called an Innovative Finance ISA (IFSA).\n\nIFISAs allow companies to access fast, efficient and sizeable investments at scale from individual investors that can help support these businesses in achieving their growth plans. This means that UK-based investors can invest up to £15,240 per year through Crowd2Fund and get tax-free returns. Then, businesses pay their investors back via the platform and they earn all the interest, rather than a bank. Traditionally, and as it is still commonplace in the market, other crowdfunding based platforms will deploy investors’ funds via a third party institution before being invested into the business seeking financing – and this third party is either a bank or large fund. By eliminating this middle man (the bank), Crowd2Fund are unique in enabling investors to put their cash direct into the businesses they want to back. By going direct, this removes any additional fees for third parties, freeing up more available returns for the end investor. That means more money in your pockets.\n\nFounded in 2014, Crowd2Fund brings together the peer-to-peer and banking credit due diligence approach, but with a crowdfunding methodology. Think of it like this – where most lending platforms are like Hotels.com, Crowd2Fund is like Airbnb.\n\nIn total, Crowd2Fund offers five types of finance to suit the specific needs of the business depending on their maturity, size and stage of financing; this includes a unique ‘Revenue Loan’ for slightly larger, more established businesses looking to take on debt financing. The Revenue Loan allows business owners to repay the loan as their company grows at scale. This provides startups with the flexibility to grow at an even faster pace – showing that peer-to-peer and crowdfunding aren’t just for small companies.\n\n\n\nUniquely with Crowd2Fund you can get the finance you need to grow your business, but also build a network of your own private investors, committed to supporting your business throughout its growth journey. On average Crowd2Fund campaigns attract 70 high net worth investors who can support with further rounds of finance or different types of finance. The high profile investor network of Crowd2Fund can also be a source for new customers.\n\nAnd the platform provides more than just capital. As part of their offering, Crowd2Fund also equips businesses with their own bespoke marketing campaign for you to promote whilst the Crowd2Fund’s London team will also spread the message far and wide giving you the best chance to reach the broadest set of people that matter, generating even greater exposure for your business.\n\nOne recent example which benefited from a Crowd2Fund campaign is online retailer Ruroc. The UK-based company develops innovative sports helmets and last year raised debt-based financing via the platform totaling £150,000. Buoyed by the stimulus this generated and the success they saw, Ruroc returned to Crowd2Fund earlier this year, this time for equity-based financing, and raised an impressive £360,000 of equity investment.\n\nDaniel Rees, the co-founder and CEO of Ruroc stated: “We are looking to accelerate our growth by partnering with Crowd2Fund to allow us to raise finance and extend our investor team to meet the demands of an increasing global customer base online.”\n\nCrowd2Fund don’t just help the businesses on their platform achieve their targets for growth – the company has lofty ambitions for themselves. As the company grows from strength to strength with more businesses and investors coming on board every month, Crowd2Fund are looking at plans to build on the success of their London HQ and expand elsewhere in Europe (France is on the list) and further afield in Asia and Australia.\n\nWhether you’re the CEO of a young company or a private investor looking to make smarter investments, Crowd2Fund has the answer – check them out!", "entities": []}

{"text": "Softbank Offers Flipkart Shares Buyout At $10 Bn Valuation.\n\nIndian ecommerce major Flipkart can soon part with more of its stake in hands of Japanese conglomerate Softbank. The Masayoshi Son led company has proposed the existing early-stage investors of Flipkart and its employees to sell their shares for $85-$89 a piece. The transaction will put Flipkart’s valuation at $10 Bn, which is a bit low, as compared to the existing $11.6 Bn valuation gained during $1.4 Bn funding round in April 2017.\n\nSince last week, the news of Tiger Global Management selling 10% shareholding in Flipkart worth $600 Mn-$700 Mn to Softbank is already making circles. Now the names of other early-stage investors including Kalaari Capital, Accel Partners, and IDG Ventures has also been added to it. If the deal happens, this will be the second major exit for Kalaari this year after Snapdeal.\n\nFurther, Softbank is also in talks with a few of the Flipkart employees to sell their shares with a cap on the maximum number of shares that can be sold.\n\nSoftbank agreed to buy the existing investors shares worth $1.4 Bn – $2 Bn when it first made the massive fund infusion of over $2 Bn in Flipkart post the failure of Snapdeal merger with the ecommerce unicorn.\n\nAs per sources, the share sale is likely to be completed by the end of December 2017.\n\nLooking at the major blows Indian ecommerce companies have faced in past few years, an exit at $10 Bn valuation for the early stage investors is a deal worth giving a chance. Tiger Global has already infused over $1 Bn in Flipkart over past 10 years and has also led the company through tough times. Also, the VC firm is looking to sell a part of its stake in cab aggregator Ola to Softbank, thus trying to pull off its feet from the Indian startup ecosystem for a while.\n\nSoftbank, on the other hand, is deeply positioning itself in the Indian tech space eyeing the maximum control in its four major bets – Flipkart, Ola, Paytm and OYO – thereby building an ecosystem of its own. Ecommerce, cab aggregators, payments and budget hotels are presently the hottest and the fastest growing sectors in India and have global appeal too. These companies have full potential to go either public in near future or get consolidated with their foreign or local incumbents. This gives Softbank an opportunity to reap in benefits a much higher valuation at both ends.\n\n(The development was reported by LiveMint)", "entities": []}

It joins Boston-based company CompuMark, the trademark clearance and protection partner for 9 out of 10 of the world’s most valuable brands.\n\nForty percent of trademarks filed contain images.

CompuMark currently applies TrademarkVision technology within TM go365™, a tool designed to enable trademark professionals to instantly research trademarks and more effectively manage day-to-day portfolios.\n\nJeff Roy, President, CompuMark, said: “CompuMark is making significant investments in its product portfolio and the business as a whole by investing in best-of-breed image recognition technology and expertise in artificial intelligence. TrademarkVision’s award-winning AI innovation and deep relationships with Patent and Trademark Offices (PTO) and government agencies around the world, combined with CompuMark’s premier data, industry-leading expertise and global reach will open opportunities for new products and solutions both within and outside the trademark research industry that will underpin the business’s next generation of solutions.”\n\nTrademarkVision’s CEO and founder Sandra Mau will remain with the company, along with COO Cameron Mitchell and their team of 30+ professionals based in Brisbane, Australia, and Pittsburgh, USA.

{"text": "On the hunt for Holy Grails, Unicorns, VC funding and other fabled creatures.\n\nThis article may be a little controversial but it is part of my mission to guide our entrepreneurs to success — and if we can stop our founders from wasting time doing things that will never bear fruit, then we are doing our job.\n\nNew venture founders are massively overly focused on VC-sourced funding – which may initially seem appropriate as lack of money is a problem that most startups face at sometime. However, there is undoubtedly a disproportionate amount of time and resource dedicated to seeking VC funding which will remain for most, a holy grail.\n\nIn the UK there were roughly 500 000 new businesses launched in 2014 and about 280 VC backed deals (Dow Jones VC Report and Companies House data) — that equates to 0.06% getting VC finance. Sure we can refine the calculation and eliminate certain types of new businesses, add in angel funding, consider cross-border transactions — but after all this even if you are in one of the more promising sectors the odds are certainly far less than three percent that a startup will ever get VC funding.\n\nUnfortunately, 9 out of 10 entrepreneurs will probably already be thinking: “yes, but I am different and my business is definitely fundable.” Let’s test that. Ignoring all the slick pitches, frenetic networking and startup jargon, there are really only a few questions you need to answer:\n\nAm I addressing a really big market?\n\nIf I am successful, is the potential return on investment massive?\n\nHave I got concrete evidence that my model can deliver this (think sustainably, competition, risk levels, scalability)?\n\nHave I got a team that can definitely make this happen?\n\nAnswer “yes” to all of these and just maybe you are in the group who just might be right for VC’s. But remembering, it is not just your venture that is important, you are being compared against plenty of other potential investment opportunities as well.\n\nHypothetically, if you are in the group that might obtain a round of finance, do you really want it? VC’s will try and reduce risk and the best way to do that is by investing in businesses that have a higher likelihood of success and with big upward potential. That translates into businesses that already have significant traction with real paying customers. If you are in that situation, would you rather not consider using customer revenue to fund your growth?\n\nThe logical conclusion is to focus on getting to that desired level of traction. Even if , despite the warnings you still wish to seek VC funding, it would still make more sense to do all you can to reduce the riskiness of your business by proving that it works and in so doing, strengthen your negotiation position before you even consider seeking funds. What is more it also gives you the option to continue bootstrapping your business and retain control if funding does not become available at acceptable terms.\n\nOn the subject of control, this is another good reason to think long and hard about the funding route because once you are on board its going to feel like you are on the fabled train in Jethro Tull’s Locomotive Breath “ the train it won’t stop going, no way to slow down” (most readers won’t recognise the reference but will get the imagery). There will be constant pressure on you to exit or move to subsequent financing rounds. The good news is you could have a skyrocketing net worth; but the negative is your control over the business is going to be moving in the opposite direction.\n\nFurthermore if you do decide to go the VC path, you are going to have to get familiar with the ever more complicated terms and conditions that the VC’s are dreaming up. Terms like full ratchet anti-dilution and reverse vesting should make a founder’s blood run cold!\n\nI am not anti-VC. I think the majority do a great job and have a valuable role in injecting money into the system. When they do invest they also generally add tremendous benefit in terms of support, experience, network and credibility. The leverage that people like AirBnB, Uber and the other “unicorns” have gained from these funds has been massive.\n\nThe inspiration and motivation that those successes provide is also a positive factor in encouraging entrepreneurship.\n\nBut lets not forget the VC’s raison d’etre is to make money for their funders, which means the better the deal they negotiate for themselves, the worse for you! Although I have heard some compelling and passionate presentations from these “suits” about how they desire to support and protect the entrepreneur, the fundamental is that a negotiation is a zero sum game and the VC’s normally hold the good cards.\n\nIn summary, we suggest:\n\nFocus on building your business all the way to real traction and waste no time on the funding trail until then.\n\nIf you then fall into the category of VC-fundable, you can consider that path, but be highly attuned to what Wasserman calls the “cash versus control” in his book The Founders Dolemma. (see this HBR article)\n\nRemember that funding does not equal success. Plenty of ventures fail post-funding, but the VC-funded casualties tend to be a lot messier to clean up.\n\nSo founders … concentrate on the areas that matter – insanely great products, customer acquisition and refining your business models to develop sustainable customer revenue streams. Learn to say “no” to the next sexy pitch or national startup event. You really do not have time for the distractions of searching for the VC Holy Grail while you have a business to build!\n\nThis article by Simon Gifford originally appeared on Mashauri.com and is republished with permission.", "entities": []}
