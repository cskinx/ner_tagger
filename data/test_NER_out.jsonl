Started by the founders of Taulia in 2017, Centrifuge is developing a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol which aims to rethink how businesses transact with each other, in a more efficient and open way. Invoicing as we know it, and more importantly the resulting delays in payment and access to liquidity will be solved for good by liberating the data from today‚Äôs siloed systems.\n\nCentrifuge is the fourth startup for the team of Silicon Valley veterans who previously built and exited successfully companies in the procure-to-pay and finance space. Centrifuge is growing its engineering and product team in Berlin, while commercial activities are based in San Francisco.\n\nA new open B2B commerce protocol with the tools to fuse traditionally walled-off silos of business data and business logic on a public, decentralized network can create significant value and facilitate a number of new use cases and applications, including a more open marketplace for funding supply chain members and smart contracts that make payment when goods are delivered or services are performed.\n\nMaex Ament, the CEO and Co-founder of Centrifuge, stated: ‚ÄúWe want to fundamentally change how businesses interact, by consigning antiquated invoicing processes to the history books. To do this, we are building a world class team in Berlin, which has some of the most talented blockchain engineers in the market.

The unitranche package will also include a dedicated committed acquisition facility to finance future build ups.\n\nFounded in 1983, Evernex has built a broad global network over time covering 160 countries through 330 stocking locations and over 400 employees, of which 200 specialized engineers. This footprint enables the Company to support and maintain its customers‚Äô locations 24/7, leveraging over 750,000 available spare parts from its inventory.\n\nEvernex‚Äôs rapid growth can be explained by dynamic organic performance, enabled by the expansion of its operations into new geographies, as well as by a selective external growth strategy, with the aim of securing the Company‚Äôs leadership in its core markets and enhancing its service range.

Its main objective is to stimulate entrepreneurship and job creation in Romania through financial support amounting to ‚Ç¨105 million. In the focus for receiving the finance are domestic startups with a proven record of soaring sales.\n\nThe funding mechanism for Romania Start-Up Plus is designed in an efficient way which includes payments in two installments. ‚ÄúThis funding mechanism in installments is a step towards more clever funding, adapted to economic realities. The support is not only a quantitative numeric indicator, it becomes an instrument to boost entrepreneurs that record results in the initial phase of their business,‚Äù explains Dan Barna, State Secretary at MFE.\n\nAs further detailed in the official press release, the entrepreneurship and funding scheme of the program is to be coordinated by an administrator. The role of the administrator could be assumed by any of the following bodies: public local authorities, Chambers of Commerce, lifelong learning and vocational training service providers, universities, or NGOs. The administrator is responsible for signing contracts with eligible entrepreneurs and tracking their performance records.\n\nDuring the first phase, the entrepreneurs sign the contracts and receive the first installment worth ‚Ç¨24,000. In order to continue to the second phase, startups are obliged to obtain a gross revenue which equals to ‚Ç¨12,000, i.e. half the value of the installment they have already received. If this requirement is satisfied, they could receive up to ‚Ç¨16,000 in additional funding as part of the second installment.\n\nAccording to the program developers, upon successful implementation of Romania Start-Up Plus, the optimal results would involve: funding of 1,500 new SMEs, opening 2,000 new job positions, and training more than 10,000 citizens. Proposals and recommendations on the guidelines of the program can be submitted by July 25, 2016, at the following e-mail address: rsup@fonduri-ue.ro.

The company had said that aligning with its growth strategy, Zivame plans to raise a larger round later in 2019.\n\nThe funding was to be used for the ongoing and future retail expansion, augmentation of technology, product development and strengthening Zivame‚Äôs omnichannel strategy.\n\nRelated Article: Trifecta Capital Makes Fresh Infusion In Lingerie Retailer Zivame As It Expands ESOP Pool\n\nZivame: New CEO And Omnichannel Growth\n\nZivame was founded in 2011 by Richa Kar and Kapil Karekar. It began its operations as an aggregator of lingerie brands. Now along with lingeries, the startup has also forayed into other segments such as activewear, sleepwear and shapewear. Grappling with an over 80% increase in losses, and just 38% growth in net sales in FY16, Zivame team was struggling to continue its survival.\n\nAs expected, the company went through a serious strategy and management revamp. Zivame re-instituted its marketplace model, pivoting from the then private label model. Then Zivame founder and CEO Richa Kar stepped down in what was called an investor-led rejig in January 2017. Shaleen Sinha, who was hired as the COO in November 2015, took over the daily operations. With the future of Zivame in jeopardy, the company‚Äôs shareholders and investor consortium appointed Amisha Jain as Zivame CEO in May 2018.\n\nThe strategy paid off a year later when the company recorded a 56.4% increase in its revenues for the financial year 2017-18 at $12.81 Mn (INR 94.26Cr) from $8.19 Mn (INR 60.25 Cr) in the previous year. As of October 2018, the company had set up over 30 brand stores and is currently looking at setting up 100 stores by the end of FY19.\n\nAt present, almost 42% of sales for Zivame come from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where online sales are being complemented by physical retail outlets.\n\nIn an earlier interaction with Inc42, Zivame CEO Amisha Jain said that as company looks at expand its reach and scale, Zivame is looking at tech-based innovations to bring more customers. It‚Äôs also launching Fitcode 2.0 which Jain said will further revolutionise the online lingerie industry by bringing customised product requirements and stocking inventory in a smart manner according to customer needs.\n\nIn January, Delhi-based lingerie startup Clovia raised $10 Mn in a Series B funding round led by AT Capital. According to startup, the fresh funds were to be used for its product and technology development, scaling up the brand portfolio, expanding to newer geographies, increasing operational efficiencies and strengthening the team.\n\nAccording to a report by Franchise India, the lingerie market in India is valued at about $3 Bn, growing at a CAGR of 42.32% between 2014 and 2019.

But both Amazon India and Swiggy declined to comment on what they described as ‚Äúmarket speculation‚Äù.\n\nBengaluru-based Swiggy was founded in August 2014 by Sriharsha Majety, Nandan Reddy and Rahul Jaimini.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone is talking, since they are doing really well, but it is not certain that a deal will be closed,‚Äù stated the source in an official statement. According to the same statement, Swiggy has also attracted the attention of other strategic investors, including Alibaba-backed Chinese food delivery venture Ele.me.\n\nIn April 2015, Swiggy raised $2 Mn from Accel Partners and SAIF Partners. In June 2015, the company secured $16.5 Mn in Series B funding from Silicon Valley-based venture capital investor Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), SAIF Partners, Accel Partners, and from an undisclosed global investment entity. In January this year, it raised $35 Mn in Series C from New York-based investors Harmony Partners and Singapore-based RB investments.\n\nSwiggy‚Äôs executives have reportedly held at least three rounds of meetings with Amazon‚Äôs India head Amit Agarwal, alongside discussions with corporate development head Abhijeet Muzumdar. Seattle-based Amazon has expressed interest in the strong consumer focus demonstrated by Swiggy, the sources said. However, it is also keen that Swiggy records gross profits before a deal is finalised.\n\nPreviously, Amazon had backed hyperlocal services company Housejoy, and retail gift card startup QwikCilver. It also invested $60 Mn in online financial marketplace Bankbazaar in India.\n\nAn investor in the hyperlocal market said, ‚ÄúFor Swiggy, getting a high order density will lead to better utilisation of the hyperlocal fleet leading to a sustainable business. After food, the next logical expansion would be grocery and Amazon Now does grocery, so maybe that‚Äôs the synergy.‚Äù\n\nSwiggy is, at present, focussing on expanding its restaurant base across cities and to break even at an operational level. It claims its core value proposition to be a dedicated delivery fleet to fulfill orders and a zero minimum order.\n\nIn August 2016, Inc42 reported that restaurants associated with Swiggy and Shadowfax have pulled back from having their orders delivered by the startups. They cited a sudden spike of 25% per order as commission charged, as one of the key reasons to end the partnership. In an attempt to increase user acquisition, Swiggy, Shadowfax, Runnr, and others charged extremely low and attractive rates of commission that ate into their own revenue.\n\nFollowing this development, four food aggregators based in Gurugram shut down their services due to severe cash-crunch. In May 2016, foodtech startup operating in the daily meals segment, Yumist, stopped its services in Bengaluru.\n\nIn yet another development, Google India too announced in August 2016 that users can now place food orders from restaurants on their phones directly via Google search. If the restaurants are listed with either Zomato or Swiggy, then they‚Äôll see an option to ‚ÄúPlace an order‚Äù in the search results.\n\nThis development was first reported in ET.", "entities": [[491, 495, "year_founded"], [1491, 1498, "headquarters_loc"], [1505, 1511, "investor"]]}

This quarter's index measurement fell from the previous quarter's index reading of 3.76 and below the nearly 16 year average of 3.70.\n\nThis is the 63rd consecutive quarterly survey, and thus, provides unique quantitative and qualitative trend data and analysis on the confidence of Silicon Valley venture capitalists in the future high-growth entrepreneurial environment. Dr. Mark Cannice, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation with the University of San Francisco (USF) School of Management, authors the research study each quarter.\n\nIn the new report, Professor Cannice indicated \"The decrease in sentiment was tied in part to concerns on lofty valuations due to a continuing enormous supply of capital being made available to new ventures as more mega funds ($500M or more) are being established.\" For example, Venky Ganesan of Menlo Ventures wrote, \"The private markets have been fueled by the availability of cheap capital and the surge of new entrants to private investing.\" Bob Ackerman of AllegisCyber confirmed there is \"too much capital chasing too much undifferentiated innovation with unrealistic return expectations.\"\n\nDr. Cannice also noted \"challenging trends to the financial model of venture capital come in the context of continuing uncertainty in the larger economic and political environment.\" To that point, Dag Syrrist of Vision Capital reasoned \"We're settling in an 'expect the un-expected mentality,' flattening equity markets and no end in sight to trade friction and policy inaction.\" Additionally, Ricky Lu of CZV Capital elaborated, \"The trade uncertainty has continued to put pressure on the venture community and increased our scrutiny of start-ups.\"\n\nCannice concluded the report by writing \"With new sources and unprecedented amounts of capital being made available to new ventures and evolving expectations of public markets for venture-backed firms in terms of paths to profitability, it could be argued that the venture industry is itself in the midst of a transformation.\"\n\nAbout the USF School of Management\n\nFounded in 1925, University of San Francisco's School of Management is on the forefront of educating the next generation of conscious, mindful business leaders.

{"text": "TRAI Gives Nod To Mobile Calls And Internet Surfing On Flights.\n\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released its recommendations for In-Flight Connectivity (IFC) on January 18, 2018. The recommendation has come after the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had sought for the TRAI‚Äôs proposal last year.\n\nFollowing the consultations and discussions on IFC, the foremost recommendation made is that both the Internet and Mobile Communication on Aircraft (MCA) service should be permitted as In-Flight Connectivity in the Indian airspace. There is, however, a minimum height restriction of 3,000m in the Indian airspace for MCA applications.\n\nInternet services through Wifi on electronic devices would be allowed for use only in the flight or aeroplane mode. To build an internet service in the flight, a separate category of ‚ÄòIFC Service Provider‚Äô registered with DoT would be created to permit IFC services in the Indian airspace and a flat annual Licence Fee of token amount INR 1 would be imposed which may be later amended as well.\n\nHowever, the service provider would be permitted to provide the IFC services only after entering into an arrangement with a Unified Licensee having Internet Service (Category ‚ÄòA‚Äô) authorisation.\n\nThe DoT letter had earlier communicated that TRAI should submit its proposal to introduce In-Flight Connectivity (IFC) for voice, data and video services over Indian airspace for domestic, international and overflying flights in the Indian airspace.\n\nThe Department had also asked TRAI to submit the associated issues such as entry fee, license fee, spectrum-related issues including usage charges and method of allocation and other conditions that surround.\n\nThe recommendation agrees that the regulatory requirements for IFC should be the same for both Indian registered and foreign registered airlines in the Indian airspace. If the recommendation is agreed upon, then the IFC service provider would be permitted to use either INSAT systems (Indian Satellite System or foreign satellite capacity leased through DoS) or foreign satellites outside INSAT systems in the Indian airspace.\n\nPost the acceptance of the recommendation, there is a humongous infrastructural work to be looked after. The imperative one being to adopt spectrum neutral approach to condition the frequency bands to harmonise and co-ordinate for their use at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).\n\nSuch a move would facilitate IFC services in all the bands (L-, Ku- and Ka-) in which IFC services are currently being provided. A major challenge lies in making the IFC services applicable for all types of flights such as commercial airlines, business jets, executive aircrafts, etc. The acceptance of the recommendations will see many private players jumping into the arena to place their stakes on In-Flight Connectivity.", "entities": []}

They will be barred from charging tariffs over an upper ceiling set by the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi in the near future.\n\nTransport Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said, ‚ÄúThe draft is ready. Soon, it will be put up for public consultation. After consultation, it will be sent to the Lt Governor (for approval).‚Äù The policy could be sent to a High Court- appointed panel to debate further considerations and then on to the Lt.

These newly created businesses will also be able to share resources with the rest of ArcticStartup and its portfolio companies. This includes switching employees, sharing office costs, etc.\n\nVaynerchuk‚Äôs straight-talk and upfront presentation style have helped him amass millions of followers on Snapchat and Twitter.

{"text": "ProtectWise Lands $20M Series B Round.\n\nTweet DENVER, CO, ProtectWise, provider of the industry's first Cloud Network DVR for complete detection, visibility and response to enterprise threats, today announced it has closed its Series B round of funding of $20 million.\n\nTo export ProtectWise funding data to PDF and Excel, click\n\nClick here for more funding data on ProtectWiseTo export ProtectWise funding data to PDF and Excel, click here In total, the company has raised more than $37 million dollars in venture capital funding since May 2013. The new funding will be used to support the company's continued growth, technology innovation and market expansion.\n\n\n\nTola Capital led the round, with follow-on investment from Crosslink Capital, Trinity Ventures, Paladin Capital Group and Arsenal Venture Partners. Sheila Gulati, managing director at Tola Capital, has joined the ProtectWise Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n'ProtectWise's Cloud Network DVR Platform represents a quantum leap in enterprise security by empowering CISOs and security teams to deftly manage risk and threats to their network. ProtectWise collects network data, provides context and intelligence to surface the most relevant threats, and delivers actionable insight through advanced visualization,' said Gulati. 'I'm joining the Board at an exciting time for ProtectWise and look forward to working closely with the company as they scale the business and continue to conquer some of security's most difficult challenges.'\n\n\n\nNetwork breaches have become commonplace with attackers present on victims' networks an average of more than six months before being discovered. Since most organizations have no long-term network memory, they're often left in the dark after they suffer a breach and it can take weeks or longer to assess the damage it has caused.\n\n\n\nThe ProtectWise Cloud Network DVR works like a virtual camera in the cloud, providing unlimited retention of full-fidelity network traffic. It correlates threat detection from proprietary research, machine learning, flow-based traffic algorithms as well as multiple commercial intelligence feeds across its customer base--providing collective security. This is combined with advanced visualization tools that allow for deep-dive forensics and faster incident response. The Cloud Network DVR is delivered as a service allowing for rapid deployment, evaluation and time to value, and eliminates the costs associated with appliance-based solutions.\n\n\n\n'ProtectWise is hitting a critical inflection point, moving from innovative start-up to proven and trusted security platform provider,' said Larry Orr, general partner at Trinity Ventures. 'Since we've begun working with ProtectWise, they haven't missed a beat, executing and expanding their deployments, growing their team effectively and continuing to innovate on their technology. The company continues to design and build ahead of the curve and is fundamentally reshaping network security.'\n\n\n\nProtectWise is seeing increased adoption of its technology as enterprises seek to better identify and respond to network threats. The company has customers in the entertainment, new media, healthcare, financial services and technology industries, including Universal Music Group.\n\n\n\n'We are driving a shift away from the old school, prevention-centric, endpoint approach to network security to a modern, integrated platform approach that is based on vastly improved detection, visibility and response,' said Scott Chasin, CEO and co-founder of ProtectWise. 'The new funding reflects the massive market opportunity for a newer way to address network security and in particular, for delivering security at scale with a unique utility model. The funding will help propel us into 2016, and Tola Capital's focused experience with enterprise software platforms makes them a great addition.'\n\n\n\nAbout ProtectWise\n\nProtectWise is disrupting the network security industry with its Cloud Network DVR, a virtual camera in the cloud that records everything on the network. The service allows security professionals to see threats in real time and continuously goes back in time to discover previously unknown threats automatically. By harnessing the power of the cloud, ProtectWise provides an integrated solution with complete detection and visibility of enterprise threats and accelerated incident response. The Cloud Network DVR delivers unique advantages over current network security solutions, including an unlimited retention window with full-fidelity forensic capacity, the industry's only automated smart retrospection, advanced security visualization, and the ease and cost-savings of an on-demand deployment model.\n\n\n\nFounded in April 2013, the company is based in Denver and led by a team of security and SaaS industry veterans from McAfee, IBM, Mandiant and Proofpoint. ProtectWise has raised more than $37 million in funding and was named to Network World's list of '10 Security Start-Ups to Watch.'

The round is led by Endeit Capital and joined by new investors Deutsche Bank, AER Ticket, the largest seller of air travel tickets in Europe, as well as Jan Valentin, the former Head of Europe at Kayak. The existing investors Project A, Creandum and btov also participated in the funding round.\n\nFounded in 2015, Comtravo‚Äôs software translates text-based requests like emails into structured data and uses AI technologies to offer the best travel options based on saved preferences and previous booking patterns. Personalized offers can be booked from an email with just one click. Comtravo was founded by Michael Riegel, Jannik Neumann, Marko Schilde and an experienced team of the travel and internet industry. Comtravo now has 110 employees. More than 700 medium-sized businesses in the DACH region use Comtravo.\n\nMichael Riegel, founder and CEO of Comtravo, stated: ‚ÄúThe German business travel market is huge ‚Äì ‚Ç¨52.5 billion. But it‚Äôs also very fragmented and shaped by tedious and inefficient processes. With Comtravo, we want to radically simplify the management of business travel. Since founding the company in 2015, we have managed to automate 60% of the processes by using technology, and we enjoy popularity from our customers and the continued support from our investors.‚Äù\n\nIn the past two years, the company has grown more than 300%, and its core business is now profitable. Among Comtravo‚Äôs ~700 customers are primarily medium-sized businesses from the DACH region, incl. the Nagel-Group, LG Innotek or Hachez. Comtravo‚Äôs systems handle over 1000 travel bookings per day. Standard requests (e.g., flight and hotel bookings) are already 60% automated with the help of technologies like natural language processing and artificial intelligence. More complex requests (e.g., group bookings) are still handled by travel experts.\n\n‚ÄúWe want to use the fresh funding to automate 80% of the booking process in the near future. Currently, well-trained travel agents have to handle time-consuming, repetitive tasks instead of dealing with more complex requests. We want to change this by continuing to automate simpler tasks so that our travel agents can focus on the really important topics and on providing excellent service,‚Äù added Michael Riegel.\n\nPhilipp Schroeder, who earlier this year joined Endeit Capital as Partner, responsible for the DACH markerts, stated: ‚ÄúTechnology and automation is constantly improving several segments of the travel industry, however, the remaining holy grail of B2B travel, SME travel, has yet to be conquered. We believe, that Comtravo has a leading position to tap into this market. Their engineering team of more than 30 people has built an outstanding tech stack that can automate the majority of its processes powered by Machine Learning. This leads to operational efficiencies and cost advantages on a large scale, enabling Comtravo to offer competitive prices and a superior service level to its customers. We are looking forward to working with this exceptional team with a strong mix of market know-how, data science, and operational excellence.‚Äù\n\nBookings on Comtravo can be done either, through the online booking tool, or by email. An internal software translates the email into structured data and automatically books the requested trip. This approach reduces the costs per booking dramatically, with the result that Comtravo can process business travel bookings almost 65% cheaper than traditional travel agencies.\n\nPartners such as airlines and hotels are directly connected to Comtravo‚Äôs backend with interfaces that guarantee seamless integration and good fares. Integrating more and more providers keeps getting more important in the industry. In addition, a recommendation algorithm helps provide personalized offers in terms of price, availability, etc. based on travelers‚Äô previous booking behavior, policies and other aspects.

Additionally the Israel Innovation Authority is leading a delegation of 20 Israeli startups, in collaboration with Invest India and Startup India.\n\nBarak Granot, Head of the Israeli Economic and Trade Mission in New Delhi said: ‚ÄúWe are excited and highly optimistic about India Israel Business Innovation Forum.
