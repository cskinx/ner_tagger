{"text": "Berlin- and San Francisco-based blockchain startup Centrifuge raises $3.8 million to build the operating system for global commerce.\n\nThe blockchain startup Centrifuge today announced the closing of a $3.8 million financing round, which was led by Mosaic Ventures and BlueYard Capital. Started by the founders of Taulia in 2017, Centrifuge is developing a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol which aims to rethink how businesses transact with each other, in a more efficient and open way. Invoicing as we know it, and more importantly the resulting delays in payment and access to liquidity will be solved for good by liberating the data from today’s siloed systems.\n\nCentrifuge is the fourth startup for the team of Silicon Valley veterans who previously built and exited successfully companies in the procure-to-pay and finance space. Centrifuge is growing its engineering and product team in Berlin, while commercial activities are based in San Francisco.\n\nA new open B2B commerce protocol with the tools to fuse traditionally walled-off silos of business data and business logic on a public, decentralized network can create significant value and facilitate a number of new use cases and applications, including a more open marketplace for funding supply chain members and smart contracts that make payment when goods are delivered or services are performed.\n\nMaex Ament, the CEO and Co-founder of Centrifuge, stated: “We want to fundamentally change how businesses interact, by consigning antiquated invoicing processes to the history books. To do this, we are building a world class team in Berlin, which has some of the most talented blockchain engineers in the market. We are super excited that Mosaic and BlueYard are leading this round – their expertise in the blockchain and decentralized internet space is a tremendous asset for Centrifuge.”\n\n“We have been actively investing in the blockchain arena for over 4 years and have interacted with hundreds of teams. We love the bold vision and the unmatched experience of the Centrifuge team, which make this a compelling opportunity and strong match with our investment thesis for the space”, said Toby Coppel, Partner and Co-founder of Mosaic.", "entities": [[51, 61, "org_in_focus"], [69, 81, "money_funded"], [116, 131, "investor"], [136, 152, "investor"], [183, 193, "org_in_focus"], [201, 213, "money_funded"], [248, 263, "investor"], [268, 284, "investor"], [337, 347, "org_in_focus"], [355, 367, "money_funded"], [402, 417, "investor"], [422, 438, "investor"], [545, 555, "org_in_focus"], [563, 575, "money_funded"], [610, 625, "investor"], [630, 646, "investor"], [722, 732, "org_in_focus"], [740, 752, "money_funded"], [787, 802, "investor"], [807, 823, "investor"], [893, 903, "org_in_focus"], [911, 923, "money_funded"], [958, 973, "investor"], [978, 994, "investor"], [1014, 1024, "org_in_focus"], [1032, 1044, "money_funded"], [1079, 1094, "investor"], [1099, 1115, "investor"], [1418, 1428, "org_in_focus"], [1436, 1448, "money_funded"], [1483, 1498, "investor"], [1503, 1519, "investor"], [1603, 1613, "org_in_focus"], [1621, 1633, "money_funded"], [1668, 1683, "investor"], [1688, 1704, "investor"], [1733, 1743, "org_in_focus"], [1751, 1763, "money_funded"], [1798, 1813, "investor"], [1818, 1834, "investor"], [1909, 1919, "org_in_focus"], [1927, 1939, "money_funded"], [1974, 1989, "investor"], [1994, 2010, "investor"], [2029, 2039, "org_in_focus"], [2047, 2059, "money_funded"], [2094, 2109, "investor"], [2114, 2130, "investor"]]}
{"text": "Ardian provides loan to refinance Carlyle-backed Evernex’s debt.\n\nArdian has provided financing to refinance Evernex‘s existing debt. No financial terms were disclosed. A portfolio company of Carlyle Europe Technology Partners, Evernex is a provider of third-party maintenance services for IT infrastructures.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nParis, July 17th 2018 – Ardian, a world-leading private investment house, today announces the arrangement of a Unitranche facility to refinance the existing debt of Evernex, a leading global provider of third party maintenance services for IT infrastructures and a Carlyle Europe Technology Partners portfolio company. The unitranche package will also include a dedicated committed acquisition facility to finance future build ups.\n\nFounded in 1983, Evernex has built a broad global network over time covering 160 countries through 330 stocking locations and over 400 employees, of which 200 specialized engineers. This footprint enables the Company to support and maintain its customers’ locations 24/7, leveraging over 750,000 available spare parts from its inventory.\n\nEvernex’s rapid growth can be explained by dynamic organic performance, enabled by the expansion of its operations into new geographies, as well as by a selective external growth strategy, with the aim of securing the Company’s leadership in its core markets and enhancing its service range. Evernex is indeed involved in a fragmented competitive landscape, which offers enticing consolidation opportunities, from which the company wishes to benefit as it did in 2016 with the acquisition of Nexeya. The Group intends to further capitalize on these opportunities to densify its network and continue supporting its customer base in their evolving IT hardware needs.\n\nCarlyle acquired a majority stake in Evernex in 2015 (named CapVert Finance at the time) and the Company has now chosen Ardian Private Debt as financing partner, thanks to its tailor-made Unitranche financing, which combines flexibility and rapidity of execution.\n\n“The acquisitive ambition of Evernex made the Unitranche choice an obvious one to unlock further opportunities and contribute to the continued growth of the business.” commented Jean-David Ponsin, Director in the Private Debt team of Ardian. Charles Villet, Associate Director at Carlyle Europe Technology Partners, added: “Ardian’s ability to deliver terms perfectly in line with the Company’s needs was key in this partnership. Ardian demonstrated a strong level of creativity and has set up a financing package particularly well suited to the story we wish to continue writing with Evernex.”\n\n“We are delighted and excited to carry out this transaction alongside Carlyle Europe Technology Partners, to support a Company with such an impressive growth track record and quality management team.” said Olivier Berment, Co-Head of Ardian Private Debt and Managing Director. “Evernex’s preference for a Unitranche solution demonstrates the strength of this type of financing, especially in the context of fast-growing companies, by providing them with the flexibility and reactivity they need to unlock their full development potential.”\n\n“With this Unitranche financing, our intention is to accelerate even further the execution of our original investment thesis and establish Evernex as the uncontested global leader in its market.” concluded Vladimir Lasocki, Managing Director at Carlyle Europe Technology Partners. “We are convinced that Ardian will prove to be a strong growth partner for Evernex in the long run, and will have the capacity to further finance the Group’s needs for its development.”\n\nABOUT ARDIAN\n\nArdian is a world-leading private investment house with assets of US$71bn managed or advised in Europe, the Americas and Asia. The company is majority-owned by its employees.

{"text": "Inaugural Crowd Invest Summit to Kick Off in Los Angeles.\n\nRobust Two-Day Equity Crowdfunding Event Will Unite Crowdfunding Experts, Investors, Entrepreneurs and Everyday Americans\n\nLOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–June 29, 2016–\n\nThe first ever Crowd Invest Summit will debut December 7-8, 2016 at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel in Santa Monica, California. The summit will feature a robust agenda spanning a variety of equity crowdfunding themes including investment analysis, marketing strategies, trends and insights from industry experts. Early bird discounted tickets are available for $99 for a limited time via the summit’s website.\n\nFounded by three equity crowdfunding industry pioneers (Josef Holm, Darren Marble and Alon Goren), the Crowd Invest Summit was developed with the vision that every American – whether accredited or not – can now be a venture capitalist.\n\nNotably, the summit will bring together every facet of the equity crowdfunding industry including angel investors, venture capital investors, retail investors, real estate investors, startups / entrepreneurs, issuers, funding portals, broker-dealers, marketing and PR firms, crowdfunding service providers, FinTech service providers and members of the media.\n\n“As the first event of its kind in the United States, the Crowd Invest Summit connects retail investors and top crowdfunded investment opportunities,” said Josef Holm, co-founder of Crowd Invest Summit, and founder and CEO of crowdfunding marketing and PR software firm Krowdster. “Given the recent shifts in the equity crowdfunding industry, we created this event to be inclusive of all types of investors. Our first summit will take place in Silicon Beach and we’re already exploring a series of domestic and international events to follow.”\n\n“The majority of crowdfunding conferences are way too technical,” said Darren Marble, co-founder of the Crowd Invest Summit and CEO of crowdfunding agency CrowdfundX. “They are filled with attorneys, accountants and platforms – who are all important resources – but the industry is desperate for a conference that caters to the everyday Americans. They are the retail investors who will ultimately fuel the growth of the industry. I am excited to be partnering with Josef and Alon on this initiative. I couldn’t think of two more experienced and connected crowdfunding experts to make this vision a reality.”\n\n“I am honored to be working with crowdfunding industry colleagues Darren and Josef on what will be the largest crowd investing event to date,” said Alon Goren, co-founder of the Crowd Invest Summit, and founder and CEO of enterprise crowdfunding software company InvestedIn.com and monthly Ventura / Santa Barbara area event 805 Startups. “For years, all three of us have been pioneers an industry with promise and excitement for a world where anyone could invest in any company, regardless of economic or social status. We’ve now built that world, and we expect to unite more companies and investors than ever before.”\n\nGoren added, “Until now, crowdfunding events have been predominantly focused on debating the potential rules and laws that are now finally in place and available. In contrast, this will be the first large-scale event in the crowdfunding sector focused on companies and investors raising real money and closing actual deals. We want all Americans to know that any of them can become venture capitalists now.”\n\nEquity Crowdfunding For All: Brief Background on Key Rulings\n\nIn an unprecedented development in March of 2015, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled on Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (also known as the JOBS Act), paving the way for private companies to raise up to $50M from both accredited and unaccredited investors. This ruling is known as “Reg A+” and is expected by many to be pivotal in the future of popular investments in America.\n\nEffective in May of 2016, regulation Crowdfunding under Title III of the JOBS Act allows private companies to raise up to $1 million annually from both accredited and unaccredited investors.\n\nGiven the groundswell of interest in both Reg A+ and Title III opportunities, the Crowd Invest Summit agenda will explore both categories.\n\nAbout The Crowd Invest Summit\n\nThe Crowd Invest Summit was founded by three pioneers in the equity crowdfunding sector: Josef Holm, Darren Marble and Alon Goren. The conference was developed with the vision that every American – whether accredited or not – can now be a venture capitalist. The summit brings together every facet of the equity crowdfunding industry including angel investors, venture capital investors, retail investors, real estate investors, startups / entrepreneurs, issuers, funding portals, broker-dealers, marketing and PR firms, crowdfunding service providers, FinTech service providers and members of the media.\n\nVisit us online at www.crowdinvestsummit.com.

{"text": "Romania Start-Up Plus: €105 Million to Stimulate Entrepreneurship.\n\nRomania Start-Up Plus is the title of the new program aiming to solve the problem of limited access to funding in Romania. The program is designed by The Ministry of European Funds (MFE) and is also part of the Human Resources Operational Program (POCU) 2014-2020. Its main objective is to stimulate entrepreneurship and job creation in Romania through financial support amounting to €105 million. In the focus for receiving the finance are domestic startups with a proven record of soaring sales.\n\nThe funding mechanism for Romania Start-Up Plus is designed in an efficient way which includes payments in two installments. “This funding mechanism in installments is a step towards more clever funding, adapted to economic realities. The support is not only a quantitative numeric indicator, it becomes an instrument to boost entrepreneurs that record results in the initial phase of their business,” explains Dan Barna, State Secretary at MFE.\n\nAs further detailed in the official press release, the entrepreneurship and funding scheme of the program is to be coordinated by an administrator. The role of the administrator could be assumed by any of the following bodies: public local authorities, Chambers of Commerce, lifelong learning and vocational training service providers, universities, or NGOs. The administrator is responsible for signing contracts with eligible entrepreneurs and tracking their performance records.\n\nDuring the first phase, the entrepreneurs sign the contracts and receive the first installment worth €24,000. In order to continue to the second phase, startups are obliged to obtain a gross revenue which equals to €12,000, i.e. half the value of the installment they have already received. If this requirement is satisfied, they could receive up to €16,000 in additional funding as part of the second installment.\n\nAccording to the program developers, upon successful implementation of Romania Start-Up Plus, the optimal results would involve: funding of 1,500 new SMEs, opening 2,000 new job positions, and training more than 10,000 citizens. Proposals and recommendations on the guidelines of the program can be submitted by July 25, 2016, at the following e-mail address: rsup@fonduri-ue.ro. The starting date for the project submission is August 12, 2016. For further details, you can access the official program calendar.", "entities": []}

Zivame re-instituted its marketplace model, pivoting from the then private label model. Then Zivame founder and CEO Richa Kar stepped down in what was called an investor-led rejig in January 2017. Shaleen Sinha, who was hired as the COO in November 2015, took over the daily operations. With the future of Zivame in jeopardy, the company’s shareholders and investor consortium appointed Amisha Jain as Zivame CEO in May 2018.\n\nThe strategy paid off a year later when the company recorded a 56.4% increase in its revenues for the financial year 2017-18 at $12.81 Mn (INR 94.26Cr) from $8.19 Mn (INR 60.25 Cr) in the previous year. As of October 2018, the company had set up over 30 brand stores and is currently looking at setting up 100 stores by the end of FY19.\n\nAt present, almost 42% of sales for Zivame come from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where online sales are being complemented by physical retail outlets.\n\nIn an earlier interaction with Inc42, Zivame CEO Amisha Jain said that as company looks at expand its reach and scale, Zivame is looking at tech-based innovations to bring more customers. It’s also launching Fitcode 2.0 which Jain said will further revolutionise the online lingerie industry by bringing customised product requirements and stocking inventory in a smart manner according to customer needs.\n\nIn January, Delhi-based lingerie startup Clovia raised $10 Mn in a Series B funding round led by AT Capital. According to startup, the fresh funds were to be used for its product and technology development, scaling up the brand portfolio, expanding to newer geographies, increasing operational efficiencies and strengthening the team.\n\nAccording to a report by Franchise India, the lingerie market in India is valued at about $3 Bn, growing at a CAGR of 42.32% between 2014 and 2019. Some other notable players in this space are Prettysecrets, Cilory, and Shyaway, among others.", "entities": [[78, 84, "org_in_focus"], [172, 176, "year_founded"], [43, 49, "org_in_focus"], [57, 63,

{"text": "Amazon India Wants A Bite Of India’s Online Food Segment; Might Invest In Swiggy.\n\nOnline shopping platform Amazon India is reportedly considering an investment in online food delivery startup, Swiggy.\n\nAccording to sources close to the development, it has already held several rounds of discussion with the startup over the past three months. But both Amazon India and Swiggy declined to comment on what they described as “market speculation”.\n\nBengaluru-based Swiggy was founded in August 2014 by Sriharsha Majety, Nandan Reddy and Rahul Jaimini.\n\n“Everyone is talking, since they are doing really well, but it is not certain that a deal will be closed,” stated the source in an official statement. According to the same statement, Swiggy has also attracted the attention of other strategic investors, including Alibaba-backed Chinese food delivery venture Ele.me.\n\nIn April 2015, Swiggy raised $2 Mn from Accel Partners and SAIF Partners. In June 2015, the company secured $16.5 Mn in Series B funding from Silicon Valley-based venture capital investor Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), SAIF Partners, Accel Partners, and from an undisclosed global investment entity. In January this year, it raised $35 Mn in Series C from New York-based investors Harmony Partners and Singapore-based RB investments.\n\nSwiggy’s executives have reportedly held at least three rounds of meetings with Amazon’s India head Amit Agarwal, alongside discussions with corporate development head Abhijeet Muzumdar. Seattle-based Amazon has expressed interest in the strong consumer focus demonstrated by Swiggy, the sources said. However, it is also keen that Swiggy records gross profits before a deal is finalised.\n\nPreviously, Amazon had backed hyperlocal services company Housejoy, and retail gift card startup QwikCilver. It also invested $60 Mn in online financial marketplace Bankbazaar in India.\n\nAn investor in the hyperlocal market said, “For Swiggy, getting a high order density will lead to better utilisation of the hyperlocal fleet leading to a sustainable business. After food, the next logical expansion would be grocery and Amazon Now does grocery, so maybe that’s the synergy.”\n\nSwiggy is, at present, focussing on expanding its restaurant base across cities and to break even at an operational level. It claims its core value proposition to be a dedicated delivery fleet to fulfill orders and a zero minimum order.\n\nIn August 2016, Inc42 reported that restaurants associated with Swiggy and Shadowfax have pulled back from having their orders delivered by the startups. They cited a sudden spike of 25% per order as commission charged, as one of the key reasons to end the partnership. In an attempt to increase user acquisition, Swiggy, Shadowfax, Runnr, and others charged extremely low and attractive rates of commission that ate into their own revenue.\n\nFollowing this development, four food aggregators based in Gurugram shut down their services due to severe cash-crunch. In May 2016, foodtech startup operating in the daily meals segment, Yumist, stopped its services in Bengaluru.\n\nIn yet another development, Google India too announced in August 2016 that users can now place food orders from restaurants on their phones directly via Google search. If the restaurants are listed with either Zomato or Swiggy, then they’ll see an option to “Place an order” in the search results.\n\nThis development was first reported in ET.", "entities": [[2, 11, "headquarters_loc"], [18, 24, "org_in_focus"], [47, 51, "year_founded"], [0, 7, "headquarters_loc"], [14, 20, "org_in_focus"], [83, 92, "headquarters_loc"], [99, 105, "org_in_focus"], [128, 132, "year_founded"], [81, 88, "headquarters_loc"], [95, 101, "org_in_focus"], [203, 212, "headquarters_loc"], [219, 225, "org_in_focus"], [248, 252, "year_founded"], [201, 208, "headquarters_loc"], [215, 221, "org_in_focus"], [346, 355, "headquarters_loc"], [362, 368, "org_in_focus"], [391, 395, "year_founded"], [344, 351, "headquarters_loc"], [358, 364, "org_in_focus"], [446, 455, "headquarters_loc"], [462, 468, "org_in_focus"], [491, 495, "year_founded"], [444, 451, "headquarters_loc"], [458, 464, "org_in_focus"], [550, 559, "headquarters_loc"], [566, 572, "org_in_focus"], [595, 599, "year_founded"], [548, 555, "headquarters_loc"], [562, 568, "org_in_focus"], [703, 712, "headquarters_loc"], [719, 725, "org_in_focus"], [748, 752, "year_founded"], [701, 708, "headquarters_loc"], [715, 721, "org_in_focus"], [868, 877, "headquarters_loc"], [884, 890, "org_in_focus"], [913, 917, "year_founded"], [866, 873, "headquarters_loc"], [880, 886, "org_in_focus"], [944, 953, "headquarters_loc"], [960, 966, "org_in_focus"], [989, 993, "year_founded"], [942, 949, "headquarters_loc"], [956, 962, "org_in_focus"], [1171, 1180, "headquarters_loc"], [1187, 1193, "org_in_focus"], [1216, 1220, "year_founded"], [1169, 1176, "headquarters_loc"], [1183, 1189, "org_in_focus"], [1304, 1313, "headquarters_loc"], [1320, 1326, "org_in_focus"], [1349, 1353, "year_founded"], [1302, 1309, "headquarters_loc"], [1316, 1322, "org_in_focus"], [1493, 1502, "headquarters_loc"], [1509, 1515, "org_in_focus"], [1538, 1542, "year_founded"], [1491, 1498, "headquarters_loc"], [1505, 1511, "org_in_focus"], [1608, 1617, "headquarters_loc"], [1624, 1630, "org_in_focus"], [1653, 1657, "year_founded"], [1606, 1613, "headquarters_loc"], [1620, 1626, "org_in_focus"], [1694, 1703, "headquarters_loc"], [1710, 1716, "org_in_focus"], [1739, 1743, "year_founded"], [1692, 1699, "headquarters_loc"], [1706, 1712, "org_in_focus"], [1805, 1814, "headquarters_loc"], [1821, 1827, "org_in_focus"], [1850, 1854, "year_founded"], [1803, 1810, "headquarters_loc"], [1817, 1823, "org_in_focus"], [1881, 1890, "headquarters_loc"], [1897, 1903, "org_in_focus"], [1926, 1930, "year_founded"], [1879, 1886, "headquarters_loc"], [1893, 1899, "org_in_focus"], [2059, 2068, "headquarters_loc"], [2075, 2081, "org_in_focus"], [2104, 2108, "year_founded"], [2057, 2064, "headquarters_loc"], [2071, 2077, "org_in_focus"], [2173, 2182, "headquarters_loc"], [2189, 2195, "org_in_focus"], [2218, 2222, "year_founded"], [2171, 2178, "headquarters_loc"], [2185, 2191, "org_in_focus"], [2298, 2307, "headquarters_loc"], [2314, 2320, "org_in_focus"], [2343, 2347, "year_founded"], [2296, 2303, "headquarters_loc"], [2310, 2316, "org_in_focus"], [2411, 2420, "headquarters_loc"], [2427, 2433, "org_in_focus"], [2456, 2460, "year_founded"], [2409, 2416, "headquarters_loc"], [2423, 2429, "org_in_focus"], [2567, 2576, "headquarters_loc"], [2583, 2589, "org_in_focus"], [2612, 2616, "year_founded"], [2565, 2572, "headquarters_loc"], [2579, 2585, "org_in_focus"], [2683, 2692, "headquarters_loc"], [2699, 2705, "org_in_focus"], [2728, 2732, "year_founded"], [2681, 2688, "headquarters_loc"], [2695, 2701, "org_in_focus"], [2853, 2862, "headquarters_loc"], [2869, 2875, "org_in_focus"], [2898, 2902, "year_founded"], [2851, 2858, "headquarters_loc"], [2865, 2871, "org_in_focus"], [2975, 2984, "headquarters_loc"], [2991, 2997, "org_in_focus"], [3020, 3024, "year_founded"], [2973, 2980, "headquarters_loc"], [2987, 2993, "org_in_focus"], [3085, 3094, "headquarters_loc"], [3101, 3107, "org_in_focus"], [3130, 3134, "year_founded"], [3083, 3090, "headquarters_loc"], [3097, 3103, "org_in_focus"], [3255, 3264, "headquarters_loc"], [3271, 3277, "org_in_focus"], [3300, 3304, "year_founded"], [3253, 3260, "headquarters_loc"], [3267, 3273, "org_in_focus"], [3384, 3393, "headquarters_loc"], [3400, 3406, "org_in_focus"], [3429, 3433, "year_founded"], [3382, 3389, "headquarters_loc"], [3396, 3402, "org_in_focus"]]}
{"text": "Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Confidence Index™ Falls in Q3 Due to Continuing Concerns on Valuations and On-Going Economic and Political Uncertainty.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Confidence Index™ for the third quarter of 2019 registered 3.58 on a 5 point scale (with 5 indicating high confidence and 1 indicating low confidence). This quarter's index measurement fell from the previous quarter's index reading of 3.76 and below the nearly 16 year average of 3.70.\n\nThis is the 63rd consecutive quarterly survey, and thus, provides unique quantitative and qualitative trend data and analysis on the confidence of Silicon Valley venture capitalists in the future high-growth entrepreneurial environment. Dr. Mark Cannice, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation with the University of San Francisco (USF) School of Management, authors the research study each quarter.\n\nIn the new report, Professor Cannice indicated \"The decrease in sentiment was tied in part to concerns on lofty valuations due to a continuing enormous supply of capital being made available to new ventures as more mega funds ($500M or more) are being established.\" For example, Venky Ganesan of Menlo Ventures wrote, \"The private markets have been fueled by the availability of cheap capital and the surge of new entrants to private investing.\" Bob Ackerman of AllegisCyber confirmed there is \"too much capital chasing too much undifferentiated innovation with unrealistic return expectations.\"\n\nDr. Cannice also noted \"challenging trends to the financial model of venture capital come in the context of continuing uncertainty in the larger economic and political environment.\" To that point, Dag Syrrist of Vision Capital reasoned \"We're settling in an 'expect the un-expected mentality,' flattening equity markets and no end in sight to trade friction and policy inaction.\" Additionally, Ricky Lu of CZV Capital elaborated, \"The trade uncertainty has continued to put pressure on the venture community and increased our scrutiny of start-ups.\"\n\nCannice concluded the report by writing \"With new sources and unprecedented amounts of capital being made available to new ventures and evolving expectations of public markets for venture-backed firms in terms of paths to profitability, it could be argued that the venture industry is itself in the midst of a transformation.\"\n\nAbout the USF School of Management\n\nFounded in 1925, University of San Francisco's School of Management is on the forefront of educating the next generation of conscious, mindful business leaders. Each year those students join the over 40,000 School of Management alumni around the world to create ethical and innovative change in the private, public, and non-profit management sectors. The School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) and the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).\n\nAbout the University of San Francisco\n\nThe University of San Francisco is located in the heart of one of the world's most innovative and diverse cities and is home to a vibrant academic community of students and faculty who achieve excellence in their fields.

{"text": "TRAI Gives Nod To Mobile Calls And Internet Surfing On Flights.\n\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released its recommendations for In-Flight Connectivity (IFC) on January 18, 2018. The recommendation has come after the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had sought for the TRAI’s proposal last year.\n\nFollowing the consultations and discussions on IFC, the foremost recommendation made is that both the Internet and Mobile Communication on Aircraft (MCA) service should be permitted as In-Flight Connectivity in the Indian airspace. There is, however, a minimum height restriction of 3,000m in the Indian airspace for MCA applications.\n\nInternet services through Wifi on electronic devices would be allowed for use only in the flight or aeroplane mode. To build an internet service in the flight, a separate category of ‘IFC Service Provider’ registered with DoT would be created to permit IFC services in the Indian airspace and a flat annual Licence Fee of token amount INR 1 would be imposed which may be later amended as well.\n\nHowever, the service provider would be permitted to provide the IFC services only after entering into an arrangement with a Unified Licensee having Internet Service (Category ‘A’) authorisation.\n\nThe DoT letter had earlier communicated that TRAI should submit its proposal to introduce In-Flight Connectivity (IFC) for voice, data and video services over Indian airspace for domestic, international and overflying flights in the Indian airspace.\n\nThe Department had also asked TRAI to submit the associated issues such as entry fee, license fee, spectrum-related issues including usage charges and method of allocation and other conditions that surround.\n\nThe recommendation agrees that the regulatory requirements for IFC should be the same for both Indian registered and foreign registered airlines in the Indian airspace. If the recommendation is agreed upon, then the IFC service provider would be permitted to use either INSAT systems (Indian Satellite System or foreign satellite capacity leased through DoS) or foreign satellites outside INSAT systems in the Indian airspace.\n\nPost the acceptance of the recommendation, there is a humongous infrastructural work to be looked after. The imperative one being to adopt spectrum neutral approach to condition the frequency bands to harmonise and co-ordinate for their use at the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).\n\nSuch a move would facilitate IFC services in all the bands (L-, Ku- and Ka-) in which IFC services are currently being provided. A major challenge lies in making the IFC services applicable for all types of flights such as commercial airlines, business jets, executive aircrafts, etc. The acceptance of the recommendations will see many private players jumping into the arena to place their stakes on In-Flight Connectivity.", "entities": []}

It aims to reach 500,000 youth by 2020.\n\nIt is being introduced in Kenya, South Africa and Tunisia by TCCAF and partners such as Mercy Corps, Microsoft, Harambee Youth Employment Accelerator and Kuza Biashara. Future launches will also take place in Liberia, Nigeria and Uganda.\n\nThe digital platform intends to provide wider accessibility and greater scale for the programme, offering life skills training, business skills training and access to employment and mentoring for 25,000 young Africans over the next three years.\n\n“The rapid pace of technology adoption across Africa presents significant opportunity for private sector, civil society and government partners to engage with youth in new ways while building the skills and connections that are essential for employment,” said Kelvin Balogun, trustee at TCCAF and business unit president at Coca-Cola Central, East and West Africa.\n\n“Harnessing the talent and ambition of youth will be essential to Africa fulfilling its long-term potential, and we aim to help support this aspiration through Youth Empowered for Success. The launch of the new YES! digital platform is an important introduction in allowing us to reach more young people across Africa while rapidly scaling the programme as it expands into new countries across the continent.”\n\nThe platform aims to ensure inclusive reach for the initiative, providing access to services for young people in remote locations and those with limited literacy skills. Built by TCCAF and its programme partners, it has been designed to support widely-available technology including SMS and voice-based mobile devices, and will be available through devices at YES! programme hubs.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Aam Aadmi To Soon Put a Fullstop On Surge Pricing In Delhi.\n\nThe Delhi government is planning to impose a fare restriction on app-based cab aggregators including Ola and Uber. They will be barred from charging tariffs over an upper ceiling set by the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi in the near future.\n\nTransport Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said, “The draft is ready. Soon, it will be put up for public consultation. After consultation, it will be sent to the Lt Governor (for approval).” The policy could be sent to a High Court- appointed panel to debate further considerations and then on to the Lt. Governor.\n\nAccording to Jain, the ministry has recommended to install meters in the vehicles run by the cab aggregators. The tariffs will be fixed by the government. Thus, the aggregators will not be able to impose surge pricing beyond the upper ceiling.\n\nJain said that setting the upper ceiling on tariffs would automatically set limits on how low the aggregators will charge. He further added, “We are fixing maximum (tariff) now, and they won’t be able to charge beyond that. (This maximum) tariff will depend upon the vehicle (which will be used).”\n\nCab Aggregators’ Run In With Trouble\n\nThe cab aggregators have been at the receiving end of flak from State governments lately. In July, the Karnataka Transport Department issued a notice to Ola, for flouting the rules after obtaining its license in the state. This came a week after Ola was seen defending Karnataka’s new regulations governing tech-based cab hailing services. Both Uber and Ola registered themselves with the Karnataka On Demand Transportation Technology Aggregators Rule, 2016. While, Ola received the license, Uber didn’t.\n\nUber had approached the court last month, after the state transport department had its vehicles impounded for not having licenses sanctioned under the new rules. Earlier this month, during a hearing, the Karnataka High Court while encouraging the advent of startups, displayed its distaste towards the ‘stifling’ policies adopted by the state government against startups, questioning regulatory norms that are restrictive in nature.\n\nLast month, the Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union called for an indefinite strike against app-based taxi services in New Delhi.\n\nEarlier in April 2016, Delhi High Court issued a notice to Delhi Government asking to file a reply on steps taken by government to stop cab aggregators (Ola & Uber,) from charging fares arbitrarily. The uproar started when Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union had called a strike against surge pricing on 18th April during the odd-even drive in Delhi. Owing to the orders by the Delhi Government, Ola and Uber have temporarily withdrawn the surge pricing. After facing backlash in Karnataka and Delhi, reports surfaced that Maharashtra too would impose restrictions on the functioning of app-based taxi aggregators such as Uber and Ola that operate in the state.\n\nThe development was reported by ET.", "entities": []}
{"text": "US Strategy Takes Center Stage for Spreadshirt’s Global Success.\n\nScaling the Partner Business is Centerpiece of 2017 Strategy\n\nBOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–January 12, 2017–\n\nPhilip Rooke, CEO of Spreadshirt, the e-commerce platform for spreading ideas on something tangible, has unveiled the grand plan for the company in 2017. The mission for the global enterprise includes a hyper focused scale up in the U.S. as harnessed by significant and sustained growth in the U.S. partner business and an aggressive plan to consolidate market leadership in the EU. These benchmarks will help fulfill the company’s mission to become a $1 billion entity that enables anyone to publish an idea on everything in less than 60 seconds.\n\nAfter leading Spreadshirt for nearly 8 years, Rooke knows that 2017 will be pivotal for sustained corporate survival. These key market forces are driving this year’s general global e-commerce strategy for sustained long-term value:\n\nSize Matters: The year ahead promises to be a tough and competitive market for smaller players as they struggle with increased marketing costs. Financing for companies without a unique niche will dry up. Serious players must grow and get really good or they will die or be absorbed by larger market players.\n\nThe year ahead promises to be a tough and competitive market for smaller players as they struggle with increased marketing costs. Financing for companies without a unique niche will dry up. Serious players must grow and get really good or they will die or be absorbed by larger market players. Internationalization is hard but urgent: Internationalization will get tougher, as Brexit and a trend towards protectionism make it harder to enter new regions. The EU is a bigger market than the U.S., providing a powerful incentive for those who get it right, but the U.S. market is too big to be ignored. Global entities must become market leaders in both regions for long-term business relevance.\n\nInternationalization will get tougher, as Brexit and a trend towards protectionism make it harder to enter new regions. The EU is a bigger market than the U.S., providing a powerful incentive for those who get it right, but the U.S. market is too big to be ignored. Global entities must become market leaders in both regions for long-term business relevance. Expectations vs. Market Opportunities: In the United States, every market is developed and the number of people chasing each market ends up growing faster than the overall market–making the global e-commerce market saturated and conditions more difficult.\n\nSpreadshirt, as the European market leader, is poised to navigate 2017 successfully and skillfully. As a well-respected e-commerce business celebrating their 15th EU anniversary and 13th U.S. anniversary in 2017, they understand that they can no longer rely on what has worked in the past. Spreadshirt recognizes that the key to global dominance is to emerge as the top print on demand platform in the U.S. to deliver sustained revenue growth and credibility as a mature global brand. Spreadshirt plans to drive U.S. sales this year as fueled by these drivers:\n\nNew Tools for Sellers: Steep investments in the new publishing system for shop owners and designers (partner area) have resulted in increased visibility for the company’s Marketplace designers across multiple international marketplaces. Early indicators are strong: an initial rise in sales of over 25%, shop registrations are up 28% globally, and the number of uploaded designs is also up a noteworthy 36% since launch. The community of 70,000 plus active partners has attained critical mass for attracting buyers with unsurpassed designs. This is the foundation of building long-term value and profits for partners and a loyal and engaged global customer base.\n\nSteep investments in the new publishing system for shop owners and designers (partner area) have resulted in increased visibility for the company’s Marketplace designers across multiple international marketplaces.

This is the foundation of building long-term value and profits for partners and a loyal and engaged global customer base. Leading Commission Structures and Pricing: Spreadshirt’s ongoing investments in their pricing and a new commission structure will enable sellers to earn much higher commissions. Some are already earning over $100,000 a month. Consumers will also benefit from clearer pricing and great design templates for groups and teams.\n\nSpreadshirt’s ongoing investments in their pricing and a new commission structure will enable sellers to earn much higher commissions.

Spreadshirt’s Collection: The ethically produced Spreadshirt Collection is the only range of clothing designed by printers for printers and has the highest customer retention within the assortment- generating nearly $30m in sales already. Spreadshirt will be introducing more fashion-orientated products to the line this year.\n\nSpreadshirt expects to win the global e-commerce race one month at a time in 2017 by driving the U.S. growth as the world recognizes that their platform is unsurpassed by any global competitors.\n\nAbout Spreadshirt\n\nSpreadshirt, an innovative global e-commerce platform for print-on-demand apparel and accessories, empowers everyone to easily buy, sell, create and share their ideas on over 175 different products.

{"text": "Serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk invests in the Helsinki-based media and events company ArcticStartup.\n\nOur friends at ArcticStartup, a Helsinki-based startup media and events company, will announce today that the serial entrepreneur and social media heavyweight Gary Vaynerchuk has become an investor in the company. Vaynerchuk, who is based in New York, has also been appointed company advisor with the aim of transforming ArcticStartup into the leading community builder for entrepreneurs and businesses in the Nordic and Baltic region. The amount of funding has not been disclosed.\n\nSince I’m a bit sceptical when it comes to Venture Capital funding for events and media businesses related to the startup industy, I asked ArcticStartup CEO Dmitri Sarle yesterday about his plans and if he sees ArcticStartup as a venture capital case.\n\nDmitri stated: “We do not see ourselves as a standard Venture Capital business. Frankly – it is something we basically are trying to tackle in the startup world. Our belief is that the “scene” is too focused on funding and that the startup world is often run by “rockstar mentality”. That is why we like to work with people like Gary who are the real deal. We also do not consider an exit for our mother company anytime soon. Once, I heard Kasparov give a talk and he mentioned something I really loved – back in the day Steve Jobs wanted to build up Apple and destroy IBM. Today, the highest level of ambition is to build a startup and sell it to Apple. We want to change that. Not only for ourselves but also for anyone we work with. Basically – the funding round is not for the media/events side of our business, instead it is for our initiative to build a community of real entrepreneurs, building real businesses.”\n\nArcticStartup plans to become more than just a media and events company, as they aim to build a community of founders. Real entrepreneurs that will not focus on raising money but on making money. One example of how they want to put this in action is to let any of their employees start a business at anytime and ArcticStartup will help them launch it and will act as co-founders. These newly created businesses will also be able to share resources with the rest of ArcticStartup and its portfolio companies. This includes switching employees, sharing office costs, etc.\n\nVaynerchuk’s straight-talk and upfront presentation style have helped him amass millions of followers on Snapchat and Twitter. His New York-based social media marketing agency VaynerMedia had 600 employees and $100 million revenue in 2016. Vaynerchuk is an angel investor and advisor to Uber, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter among others. He is also co-starring alongside Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow and Will.I.Am in Apple’s first ever TV show production, Planet of the Apps.\n\nOn his last visit to Finland as a speaker at last year’s Nordic Business Forum, Vaynerchuk got to know ArcticStartup and its ambitions to help startup entrepreneurs through creating communities.\n\nVaynerchuck concluded: “I admire the ArcticStartup founders’ perseverance and I believe this company will be successful. What fascinates me in the Nordics is learning about the consumer behavior, and you also have some great brands I’d love to bring into 2017 in terms of social selling. In addition to working with leading brands, I’m open to ideas for making new investments in the region.”\n\nPartner and Chief Innovation Officer Jan Ameri at ArcticStartup commented: “Getting Gary on board is probably the biggest win in our 10-year history, something we are really proud of that validates our big vision of creating communities that truly benefit businesses from startups to big corporations. We are looking forward to working with him during our next growth leap.”\n\nArcticStartup was launched as a blog in 2007 and has lately transformed into a media, community and events organization. Startups will have an opportunity to meet Gary Vaynerchuk and apply to pitch to him live on stage at the company’s flagship event Arctic15, held in Helsinki in May, 2018.", "entities": [[2, 15, "org_in_focus"], [42, 46, "year_founded"], [107, 120, "org_in_focus"], [147, 151, "year_founded"], [323, 336, "org_in_focus"], [363, 367, "year_founded"], [545, 558, "org_in_focus"], [585, 589, "year_founded"], [590, 603, "org_in_focus"], [630, 634, "year_founded"], [843, 856, "org_in_focus"], [883, 887, "year_founded"], [925, 938, "org_in_focus"], [965, 969, "year_founded"], [1007, 1020, "org_in_focus"], [1047, 1051, "year_founded"], [1129, 1142, "org_in_focus"], [1169, 1173, "year_founded"], [1202, 1215, "org_in_focus"], [1242, 1246, "year_founded"], [1271, 1284, "org_in_focus"], [1311, 1315, "year_founded"], [1419, 1432, "org_in_focus"], [1459, 1463, "year_founded"], [1500, 1513, "org_in_focus"], [1540, 1544, "year_founded"], [1524, 1537, "org_in_focus"], [1564, 1568, "year_founded"], [1581, 1594, "org_in_focus"], [1621, 1625, "year_founded"], [1764, 1777, "org_in_focus"], [1804, 1808, "year_founded"], [1885, 1898, "org_in_focus"], [1925, 1929, "year_founded"], [1962, 1975, "org_in_focus"], [2002, 2006, "year_founded"], [2146, 2159, "org_in_focus"], [2186, 2190, "year_founded"], [2274, 2287, "org_in_focus"], [2314, 2318, "year_founded"], [2335, 2348, "org_in_focus"], [2375, 2379, "year_founded"], [2464, 2477, "org_in_focus"], [2504, 2508, "year_founded"], [2577, 2590, "org_in_focus"], [2617, 2621, "year_founded"], [2676, 2689, "org_in_focus"], [2716, 2720, "year_founded"], [2748, 2761, "org_in_focus"], [2788, 2792, "year_founded"], [2814, 2827, "org_in_focus"], [2854, 2858, "year_founded"], [3010, 3023, "org_in_focus"], [3050, 3054, "year_founded"], [3133, 3146, "org_in_focus"], [3173, 3177, "year_founded"], [3300, 3313, "org_in_focus"], [3340, 3344, "year_founded"], [3404, 3417, "org_in_focus"], [3444, 3448, "year_founded"], [3708, 3721, "org_in_focus"], [3748, 3752, "year_founded"], [3780, 3793, "org_in_focus"], [3820, 3824, "year_founded"], [3903, 3916, "org_in_focus"], [3943, 3947, "year_founded"]]}

{"text": "Croatian Aspida raises 146,000 euros on Funderbeam.\n\nAspida, the Croatian new digital media company best known for their Izzy keyboard and TVizzy broadcaster, raised 146,000 euros on the fund raising platform – Funderbeam, Croatian media reported.\n\nStarting with an initial goal to raise 100,000 euros, in just a month Aspida managed to attract 99 investors (most of them coming from overseas) investing 146,000 euros in this startup to date.\n\n“We are collecting money so we can move from the local market – the one in Croatia and its surroundings- to the bigger international markets. We strongly believe that both our products – Izzy keyboard and TVizzy broadcaster- would have a great chance on the global market as well”, – Marin Erceg, the CEO of Aspida told Netokracija.\n\nThe biggest investors so far are from Croatia and Germany. Moreover, the biggest investor is Croatian Jadran Kapital, a company that is investing in this startup since the very first day. This is the company that, back in 2015, secured their first fund. Now, in this round Jadran Kapital has invested 15,000 euros, followed by the investment from a German undisclosed company that has invested 13,000 euros. The rest of the money is coming from smaller investors who are investing 100 euros and more in this startup.\n\nFounded in 2015, Aspida is a startup with headquarters in Croatia and branches in Macedonia (Aspida d.o.o. Skopje) and United Kingdom (Aspida Ltd. London). At the moment, two fully developed applications for mobile devices (iOS and Android) are on the market: Izzy and TVizzy.\n\nIzzy keyboard represents uniquely designed keyboard application for faster, easier and fun way to write symbols and emoticons with one swipe. Izzy keyboard is branded which means its designs can represent various sports clubs, musicians, tourist associations, movies, political parties and so on. Whereas, TVizzy is video push-notification application which offers users real time videos with content preselected by end-user. TVizzy is developed in partnership with Hrvatski Telekom (Croatian Telekom), which is part of Deutsche Telekom group and it has potential to become a new digital broadcaster.\n\nFunderbeam, on the other side, is world’s first primary and secondary market for early-stage investments secured by the blockchain and with free data intelligence on +180k startups/investors. Its mission is to make it easy to invest and trade in growth companies so that great teams and investors everywhere can create the world where good ideas always win.", "entities": [[0, 15,

It is among the top ten highest grossing social casino games on Facebook.\n\n\n\nSocial casino games are free to play but players can purchase virtual credits in order to unlock more features and get upgrades, gifts, bonuses and more.\n\n\n\nPlumbee also has a joint venture with leading online gambling company Unibet, called 'Bonza Gaming'. The jv is behind 'Bonza Slots', one of the first ever real-money casino games on Facebook; and more recently has launched 'Bonza Casino'.\n\n\n\nPlumbee was co-founded by Chief Executive Officer Raf Keustermans, Chief Operating Officer Gerald Tan and Chief Technology Officer Jodi Moran; who together combine expertise across areas including digital gaming, advertising, design, marketing, technology and finance.\n\n\n\nToday their London based company has employs over 50 people including designers, engineers, product managers, analysts and marketers.\n\n\n\nLucas Church, Chair of Endemol's Group Commercial Board, comments: 'Social casino gaming is a fast emerging market and Plumbee is one of the most innovative and dynamic operators in this space.

Endemol will become a strategic shareholder and this will enable us to leverage the company's international network and globally recognised brands. This will significantly boost the growth of our worldwide user base as we create gaming experiences that stand out from the competition.'\n\n\n\nEndemol's current digital gaming projects include a new initiative to move into app publishing, launching with gaming apps based on hit shows Pointless and Deal or No Deal. Recent successes include The Money Drop second screen game, which has so far had over 30 million games played worldwide; The Million Pound Drop app in the UK, which has had over 2.5 million downloads

{"text": "Bamboo Learning Introduces Alexa Skill Highlighting Many of the World's Most Fascinating Historical Figures.\n\nSEATTLE, Dec. 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Bamboo Learning , the leader in voice-powered education, announced Bamboo® Luminaries skill for Alexa, a free, education-focused game that showcases prominent or lesser-known influential historical figures from diverse fields including architecture, art, film, geography, history, literature, music, science, social justice, and sports. The company also announced $1.4 million in seed financing, which will be used to build more experiences like Bamboo Luminaries.\n\n\"Bamboo Luminaries brings important historical figures to life in a fun, educational, interactive game that adults, teens, and families will enjoy playing together,\" said Ian Freed, CEO of Bamboo Learning. \"Bamboo Luminaries builds on our award-winning work developing Alexa skills to give people a new, engaging way to learn history and about the people who helped shape our world.\"\n\nEach day Bamboo Luminaries offers a different \"Luminary of the Day\" -- some well-known and some more obscure -- as well as opportunities to earn points, badges, and advance in the rankings by taking Luminary quizzes and playing Guess a Luminary. Players who have Alexa screen-based devices, including Echo Show, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV stick, and Fire tablets, can view images, text, and graphics that enhance the voice-first educational game.\n\n\"With Bamboo Luminaries, our goal is to give people a new and enjoyable way to learn about important historical figures with different areas of expertise, as well as a broad range of ethnic, racial, and geographic backgrounds,\" said Irina Fine, COO and Senior Vice President of Content for Bamboo Learning. \"Based on early feedback, we believe we have enlivened history in a way that has never been done before, introducing game-interaction using voice and visual Alexa capabilities. If Bamboo Luminaries can spark adults, teens, and families to explore more about history, we will have succeeded.\"\n\nBamboo Luminaries introduces captivating historical anecdotes, such as how Ada Lovelace came to be known as the world's first computer programmer, how many roles Harriet Tubman had with the Union Army during the Civil War, or why Impressionism is so closely associated with Claude Monet. It currently features 76 historical luminaries.\n\n\"The Bamboo Luminaries skill for Alexa introduces historical figures in a new and entertaining way, through voice and rich visuals,\" said Kevin Sontgerath, General Manager, Alexa Skills, Amazon.com. \"We're excited that Alexa customers can listen to the Luminary of the Day, compete on points, badges, and rankings, and have fun learning about history at the same time.\"\n\nBamboo Luminaries can be enabled for free in more than 80 countries by saying \"Alexa, open Bamboo Luminaries\" to any Alexa-enabled device. Bamboo Luminaries also can be enabled using the Alexa app or via Bamboo Learning at: www.bamboolearning.com .

Customers with screen-based Alexa devices will see an artistic , historically-relevant photo. After hearing the brief introductory information about the luminary, players can choose to hear more details and take a quiz to earn points and badges. At any point, players can \"Guess a Luminary\" by listening to three to five clues and seeing if they can identify a randomly selected luminary and earn points. Additionally, customers may \"Explore Luminaries\" to learn about other important historical figures, which Alexa lists in successive groups of three. After earning points, customers often move up in the ranking relative to other Bamboo Luminaries players.\n\n\"It is sometimes difficult to remember a large number of historical facts,\" said 14 year-old Max S. \"When I play Bamboo Luminaries, I have a blast competing with friends, my sisters and my parents, and it almost makes me forget that I'm learning about history.\"\n\n\"I loved Bamboo Luminaries! It was super-easy to use as a family, over breakfast and after school,\" said Amy Montoya from New York. \"We learned cool facts about history as we lived our lives. It also helped my girls narrow down topics for their social studies project. A big hit with our family!\"\n\nHOW BAMBOO GROVE WORKS\n\nBamboo Grove lets players review progress in Bamboo Luminaries, including dates and times used, number of quiz questions attempted, correct and incorrect answers, points earned, badges earned, and overall player ranking.\n\nCustomers sign up for a Bamboo Learning account at www.bamboolearning.com/grove to access Bamboo Grove where they can link to the Bamboo Luminaries skills within the Alexa App. Then they can view results and follow progress in the skill using a PC or mobile browser.\n\nAbout Bamboo Learning\n\nBased in Seattle, Bamboo Learning is the award-winning leader in voice-powered education with a mission to bring engaging, high-quality educational experiences to customers around the world.

The new funding will be used to support the company's continued growth, technology innovation and market expansion.\n\n\n\nTola Capital led the round, with follow-on investment from Crosslink Capital, Trinity Ventures, Paladin Capital Group and Arsenal Venture Partners. Sheila Gulati, managing director at Tola Capital, has joined the ProtectWise Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n'ProtectWise's Cloud Network DVR Platform represents a quantum leap in enterprise security by empowering CISOs and security teams to deftly manage risk and threats to their network. ProtectWise collects network data, provides context and intelligence to surface the most relevant threats, and delivers actionable insight through advanced visualization,' said Gulati. 'I'm joining the Board at an exciting time for ProtectWise and look forward to working closely with the company as they scale the business and continue to conquer some of security's most difficult challenges.'\n\n\n\nNetwork breaches have become commonplace with attackers present on victims' networks an average of more than six months before being discovered. Since most organizations have no long-term network memory, they're often left in the dark after they suffer a breach and it can take weeks or longer to assess the damage it has caused.\n\n\n\nThe ProtectWise Cloud Network DVR works like a virtual camera in the cloud, providing unlimited retention of full-fidelity network traffic. It correlates threat detection from proprietary research, machine learning, flow-based traffic algorithms as well as multiple commercial intelligence feeds across its customer base--providing collective security. This is combined with advanced visualization tools that allow for deep-dive forensics and faster incident response. The Cloud Network DVR is delivered as a service allowing for rapid deployment, evaluation and time to value, and eliminates the costs associated with appliance-based solutions.\n\n\n\n'ProtectWise is hitting a critical inflection point, moving from innovative start-up to proven and trusted security platform provider,' said Larry Orr, general partner at Trinity Ventures. 'Since we've begun working with ProtectWise, they haven't missed a beat, executing and expanding their deployments, growing their team effectively and continuing to innovate on their technology. The company continues to design and build ahead of the curve and is fundamentally reshaping network security.'\n\n\n\nProtectWise is seeing increased adoption of its technology as enterprises seek to better identify and respond to network threats. The company has customers in the entertainment, new media, healthcare, financial services and technology industries, including Universal Music Group.\n\n\n\n'We are driving a shift away from the old school, prevention-centric, endpoint approach to network security to a modern, integrated platform approach that is based on vastly improved detection, visibility and response,' said Scott Chasin, CEO and co-founder of ProtectWise. 'The new funding reflects the massive market opportunity for a newer way to address network security and in particular, for delivering security at scale with a unique utility model. The funding will help propel us into 2016, and Tola Capital's focused experience with enterprise software platforms makes them a great addition.'\n\n\n\nAbout ProtectWise\n\nProtectWise is disrupting the network security industry with its Cloud Network DVR, a virtual camera in the cloud that records everything on the network. The service allows security professionals to see threats in real time and continuously goes back in time to discover previously unknown threats automatically. By harnessing the power of the cloud, ProtectWise provides an integrated solution with complete detection and visibility of enterprise threats and accelerated incident response. The Cloud Network DVR delivers unique advantages over current network security solutions, including an unlimited retention window with full-fidelity forensic capacity, the industry's only automated smart retrospection, advanced security visualization, and the ease and cost-savings of an on-demand deployment model.\n\n\n\nFounded in April 2013, the company is based in Denver and led by a team of security and SaaS industry veterans from McAfee, IBM, Mandiant and Proofpoint. ProtectWise has raised more than $37 million in funding and was named to Network World's list of '10 Security Start-Ups to Watch.'

Holland & Hart LLP served as legal adviser to Tax Guard. Raymond James & Associates was Tax Guard’s financial adviser.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ — Falfurrias Capital Partners, a Charlotte-based private equity firm focused on investing in growth-oriented, middle-market businesses, today announced it has closed an investment in financial technology firm Tax Guard. Tax Guard is the leading provider of proprietary data and services that help lenders accurately assess tax-related credit risk associated with potential borrowers.\n\nTax Guard, co-founded in 2009 by CEO Hansen Rada and based in Boulder, Colorado, is the first company in the U.S. to give lenders real-time insights into a client’s hidden tax liabilities, information typically not available to lenders unless and until the IRS files a tax lien. With the IRS filing far fewer liens relative to the increase in delinquent tax accounts, the visibility gap – and underwriting risk – for lenders has grown rapidly.\n\n“Tax Guard has been a pioneer in identifying and successfully leveraging the opportunity presented by the growth of ‘shadow’ tax liabilities and the complications they create for lenders in underwriting debt,” said Marc Oken, co-founder of Falfurrias Capital Partners. “Tax Guard is well positioned for significant growth organically and through complementary investments, and we look forward to working with Hansen and his team to scale the business by providing new technology and data solutions to financial services providers.”\n\nChris Marshall, co-founder and former CFO of Capital Bank, an early Falfurrias Capital Partners portfolio investment, will join Tax Guard as executive chairman. Marshall was previously a senior executive at Bank of America and served as CFO of Fifth Third Bancorp. Mr. Oken, a former Bank of America CFO and Joe Price, also a former Bank of America CFO and Head of Consumer and Small Business Banking, will be joining the board along with Geordie Pierson, a principal in Falfurrias Capital Partners.\n\n“Falfurrias Capital Partners, with its unmatched depth of experience in financial services, industry relationships and understanding of the forces driving the adoption by banks of third-party technology and data solutions, is the ideal partner for Tax Guard as we seek to take advantage of the significant growth in demand from new and existing customers,” said Mr. Rada. “We are excited about the insights and opportunities Marc and the rest of the team can bring to the challenge of identifying new ways to meet the evolving needs of financial institutions.”\n\nHolland & Hart LLP served as legal advisor to Tax Guard on the transaction. Raymond James & Associates was Tax Guard’s financial advisor.\n\nAbout Tax Guard\n\nEstablished in 2009, Tax Guard is the first company in the U.S. to give lenders insight into their clients’ hidden real-time tax risks well before federal tax liens are filed. Lenders throughout the U.S. rely on Tax Guard’s proprietary due diligence and monitoring reports both prior to financing and throughout the course of their lending relationships. Headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, Tax Guard utilizes a patent-pending, integrated process based on data obtained directly from the Internal Revenue Service.

{"text": "Silvertree invests in Cape Town development agency We Are Monsters.\n\nSilvertree Internet Holdings has announced an investment in newly-founded web and mobile development agency We Are Monsters (WAM), while the two have also signed a partnership that makes WAM the preferred development provider for Silvertree’s portfolio.\n\nSilvertree, which recently invested over ZAR10 million (US$730,000) in Cape Town-based organic e-commerce startup Faithful to Nature and also has the likes of Cybercellar, WineCo, Click n Compare and Sprout in its portfolio, said recently it had invested over ZAR20 million (US$1.47 million) in tech companies in the first seven months of 2015.\n\nThe latest confirmed investment is in We Are Monsters, a development agency serving digital agencies and startups that want to develop campaigns or applications. Silvertree said the startup has a wealth of knowledge in the processes of large multinational corporations, and assists and mitigates the risk for their clients in the development life cycle of a campaign.\n\nFounders Stephan Steynfaardt and Pieter van Reenen have a combined twenty years of development experience in the IT security and digital marketing environment. After only three months of business, WAM has already acquired Ogilvy and Gorilla Media as clients for a multitude of online commerce projects.\n\n“We will be working with many of the most exciting companies in South Africa – and the rest of the continent – on ground-breaking and innovative projects,” said Van Reenen.\n\n“This partnership with Silvertree gives us a chance to really showcase our ability. To create not just great websites and apps, but also top-class digital marketing.”\n\nSilvertree director Paul Cook said the company was “incredibly excited” to be working with the We Are Monsters team as its preferred developers.\n\n“They have top-of-the-range technical expertise, deep interest in building businesses, and an incredible, young culture,” Cook said.\n\nA number of other Silvertree investments are set to be announced in the coming weeks, with the company saying its investments so far this year include over ZAR16 million (US$1.18 million) of first-time investments in the e-commerce, online travel and IT development industries respectively.\n\nSilvertree Internet Holdings is the holding vehicle of early-stage investor Silvertree Capital and strongly focused on operational and marketing execution within portfolio companies.\n\nThe trio behind Silvertree – Cook, Peter Allerstorfer and Manuel Koser – believe the biggest opportunities for tech investment in Africa are in working with businesses driven by strong teams that are executing simple, proven models. The company has what it describes as a “continuous focus” on revenue and margins.\n\n“We watch the numbers every day, every hour, checking progress, making adjustments. It’s all about execute, execute, execute,” Koser said.\n\nCook said African startups and investors can be too quick to try to copy Silicon Valley, and sometimes forget that building a viable business requires finding customers and generating revenue.\n\n“Smart potential investors are seeking businesses that have proven they will be able to make money – not just great ideas,” he said.", "entities": [[0, 10, "investor"], [22, 31, "headquarters_loc"], [54, 66, "investor"], [116, 134, "org_in_focus"], [277, 292, "money_funded"], [67, 77, "investor"], [89, 98, "headquarters_loc"], [121, 133, "investor"], [183, 201, "org_in_focus"], [344, 359, "money_funded"], [322, 332, "investor"], [344, 353, "headquarters_loc"], [376, 388, "investor"], [438, 456, "org_in_focus"], [599, 614, "money_funded"], [668, 678, "investor"], [690, 699, "headquarters_loc"], [722, 734, "investor"], [784, 802, "org_in_focus"], [945, 960, "money_funded"], [832, 842, "investor"], [854, 863, "headquarters_loc"], [886, 898, "investor"], [948, 966, "org_in_focus"], [1109, 1124, "money_funded"], [1037, 1047, "investor"], [1059, 1068, "headquarters_loc"], [1091, 1103, "investor"], [1153, 1171, "org_in_focus"], [1314, 1329, "money_funded"], [1199, 1209, "investor"], [1221, 1230, "headquarters_loc"], [1253, 1265, "investor"], [1315, 1333, "org_in_focus"], [1476, 1491, "money_funded"], [1341, 1351, "investor"], [1363, 1372, "headquarters_loc"], [1395, 1407, "investor"], [1457, 1475, "org_in_focus"], [1618, 1633, "money_funded"], [1515, 1525, "investor"], [1537, 1546, "headquarters_loc"], [1569, 1581, "investor"], [1631, 1649, "org_in_focus"], [1792, 1807, "money_funded"], [1601, 1611, "investor"], [1623, 1632, "headquarters_loc"], [1655, 1667, "investor"], [1717, 1735, "org_in_focus"], [1878, 1893, "money_funded"], [1683, 1693, "investor"], [1705, 1714, "headquarters_loc"], [1737, 1749, "investor"], [1799, 1817, "org_in_focus"], [1960, 1975, "money_funded"], [1829, 1839, "investor"], [1851, 1860, "headquarters_loc"], [1883, 1895, "investor"], [1945, 1963, "org_in_focus"], [2106, 2121, "money_funded"], [1963, 1973, "investor"], [1985, 1994, "headquarters_loc"], [2017, 2029, "investor"], [2079, 2097, "org_in_focus"], [2240, 2255, "money_funded"], [2255, 2265, "investor"], [2277, 2286, "headquarters_loc"], [2309, 2321, "investor"], [2371, 2389, "org_in_focus"], [2532, 2547, "money_funded"], [2439, 2449, "investor"], [2461, 2470, "headquarters_loc"], [2493, 2505, "investor"], [2555, 2573, "org_in_focus"], [2716, 2731, "money_funded"], [2674, 2684, "investor"], [2696, 2705, "headquarters_loc"], [2728, 2740, "investor"], [2790, 2808, "org_in_focus"], [2951, 2966, "money_funded"], [2755, 2765, "investor"], [2777, 2786, "headquarters_loc"], [2809, 2821, "investor"], [2871, 2889, "org_in_focus"], [3032, 3047, "money_funded"], [2841, 2851, "investor"], [2863, 2872, "headquarters_loc"], [2895, 2907, "investor"], [2957, 2975, "org_in_focus"], [3118, 3133, "money_funded"], [2895, 2905, "investor"], [2917, 2926, "headquarters_loc"], [2949, 2961, "investor"], [3011, 3029, "org_in_focus"], [3172, 3187, "money_funded"], [3089, 3099, "investor"], [3111, 3120, "headquarters_loc"], [3143, 3155, "investor"], [3205, 3223, "org_in_focus"], [3366, 3381, "money_funded"]]}

{"text": "Berlin-based business travel startup Comtravo raises €21 million additional funding to accelerate growth.\n\nComtravo, a Berlin-based platform for business travel bookings, just raised additional €21 million in venture capital. The round is led by Endeit Capital and joined by new investors Deutsche Bank, AER Ticket, the largest seller of air travel tickets in Europe, as well as Jan Valentin, the former Head of Europe at Kayak. The existing investors Project A, Creandum and btov also participated in the funding round.\n\nFounded in 2015, Comtravo’s software translates text-based requests like emails into structured data and uses AI technologies to offer the best travel options based on saved preferences and previous booking patterns. Personalized offers can be booked from an email with just one click. Comtravo was founded by Michael Riegel, Jannik Neumann, Marko Schilde and an experienced team of the travel and internet industry. Comtravo now has 110 employees. More than 700 medium-sized businesses in the DACH region use Comtravo.\n\nMichael Riegel, founder and CEO of Comtravo, stated: “The German business travel market is huge – €52.5 billion. But it’s also very fragmented and shaped by tedious and inefficient processes. With Comtravo, we want to radically simplify the management of business travel. Since founding the company in 2015, we have managed to automate 60% of the processes by using technology, and we enjoy popularity from our customers and the continued support from our investors.”\n\nIn the past two years, the company has grown more than 300%, and its core business is now profitable. Among Comtravo’s ~700 customers are primarily medium-sized businesses from the DACH region, incl. the Nagel-Group, LG Innotek or Hachez. Comtravo’s systems handle over 1000 travel bookings per day. Standard requests (e.g., flight and hotel bookings) are already 60% automated with the help of technologies like natural language processing and artificial intelligence. More complex requests (e.g., group bookings) are still handled by travel experts.\n\n“We want to use the fresh funding to automate 80% of the booking process in the near future. Currently, well-trained travel agents have to handle time-consuming, repetitive tasks instead of dealing with more complex requests. We want to change this by continuing to automate simpler tasks so that our travel agents can focus on the really important topics and on providing excellent service,” added Michael Riegel.\n\nPhilipp Schroeder, who earlier this year joined Endeit Capital as Partner, responsible for the DACH markerts, stated: “Technology and automation is constantly improving several segments of the travel industry, however, the remaining holy grail of B2B travel, SME travel, has yet to be conquered. We believe, that Comtravo has a leading position to tap into this market. Their engineering team of more than 30 people has built an outstanding tech stack that can automate the majority of its processes powered by Machine Learning. This leads to operational efficiencies and cost advantages on a large scale, enabling Comtravo to offer competitive prices and a superior service level to its customers. We are looking forward to working with this exceptional team with a strong mix of market know-how, data science, and operational excellence.”\n\nBookings on Comtravo can be done either, through the online booking tool, or by email. An internal software translates the email into structured data and automatically books the requested trip. This approach reduces the costs per booking dramatically, with the result that Comtravo can process business travel bookings almost 65% cheaper than traditional travel agencies.\n\nPartners such as airlines and hotels are directly connected to Comtravo’s backend with interfaces that guarantee seamless integration and good fares. Integrating more and more providers keeps getting more important in the industry. In addition, a recommendation algorithm helps provide personalized offers in terms of price, availability, etc. based on travelers’ previous booking behavior, policies and other aspects. In the future, new features will be released as, for example, automatic check-in.", "entities": [[0, 6, "headquarters_loc"], [37, 45, "org_in_focus"], [53, 64, "money_funded"], [2, 10,

{"text": "SoftBank Invests $60 Mn In Grofers’ Larger Funding Round.\n\nTiger Global and Sequoia also participated in the round\n\nGurugram-based online grocery startup Grofers has raised nearly $60 Mn in a fresh Series F funding round from Masayoshi Son-led SoftBank Vision Fund (SVF). This is reportedly the first tranche of the larger $120 Mn-$140 Mn funding round that is under works for Grofers.\n\nA source close to the development confirmed the funding to Inc42. With the fresh funding, Grofers is now valued at $425 Mn post-money according to data intelligence platform paper.vc. Currently, SVF holds around 42% stake in the company.\n\nFounded in 2013 by IIT graduates Albinder Dhindsa and Saurabh Kumar, Grofers offers products across categories such as grocery, fruits and vegetables, beauty and wellness, household care, baby care, pet care, bakery, and meats and seafood, among other things. It operates in 13 cities.\n\nSoftBank had earlier led a $62Mn funding round in Grofers, acquiring 35-40% stake in the company in February.\n\nThe funding comes after reports surfaced in October 2018 that SoftBank may invest $140 Mn – $150 Mn (INR 1,027 Cr – INR 1,100 Cr) in the company with participation from German retail group Metro AG.\n\nIn the funding round, Grofers’ existing investors Sequoia and Tiger Global also invested $1.8 Mn and $19 Mn. SoftBank is further expected to invest $40 Mn in Grofers as it looks to close a deal with the new investor.\n\nGrofers closed FY 2018 with $129.49 Mn (INR 950 Cr) in sales. It is now chasing a revenue target of $34 Mn (INR 2,500 Cr) and plans to roll out more than 500 stock keeping units (SKUs) for FY 2019.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the recent activities at Grofers:\n\nGrofers recorded revenue of INR 310 Cr in January 2019 in lieu of its sale season\n\nGrofers has stopped offering fresh products as it is concentrating its energy on private labels — Budget and Popular G-Brands\n\nIt has expanded its private labels to offer 250 food and non-food products to its consumers\n\nIt is targeting a stronger growth trajectory in 2019, with a 50% contribution from its private brands\n\nGrofers has changed its focus to establishing its foothold in Delhi-NCR by investing in its supply chain and technology\n\nThe company claims to be profitable in Delhi on a per-order basis\n\nOnline grocery sector is expected to almost quadruple over the next three years to touch $1.38 Bn (INR 100 Bn) in terms of revenue. A Goldman Sachs report forecast that the Indian online grocery market is set to reach $40 Mn (INR 270 Cr) by FY19, growing at a CAGR of 62% from 2016 to 2022.\n\nThe sector, which has seen with high-investor attraction from the likes of SoftBank, Tencent, Temasek, etc, has been struggling for growth and to manage high rates of cash burn.", "entities": [[0, 8, "investor"], [17, 23, "money_funded"], [13, 17, "year_founded"], [191, 199, "investor"], [57, 65, "investor"], [74, 80, "money_funded"], [70, 74, "year_founded"], [248, 256, "investor"], [272, 280, "investor"], [289, 295, "money_funded"], [285, 289, "year_founded"], [463, 471, "investor"], [385, 393, "investor"], [402, 408, "money_funded"], [398, 402, "year_founded"], [576, 584, "investor"], [453, 461, "investor"], [470, 476, "money_funded"], [466, 470, "year_founded"], [644, 652, "investor"], [571, 579, "investor"], [588, 594, "money_funded"], [584, 588, "year_founded"], [762, 770, "investor"], [624, 632, "investor"], [641, 647, "money_funded"], [637, 641, "year_founded"], [815, 823, "investor"], [886, 894, "investor"], [903, 909, "money_funded"], [899, 903, "year_founded"], [1077, 1085, "investor"], [911, 919, "investor"], [928, 934, "money_funded"], [924, 928, "year_founded"], [1102, 1110, "investor"], [1022, 1030, "investor"], [1039, 1045, "money_funded"], [1035, 1039, "year_founded"], [1213, 1221, "investor"], [1222, 1230, "investor"], [1239, 1245, "money_funded"], [1235, 1239, "year_founded"], [1413, 1421, "investor"], [1333, 1341, "investor"], [1350, 1356, "money_funded"], [1346, 1350, "year_founded"], [1524, 1532, "investor"], [1440, 1448, "investor"], [1457, 1463, "money_funded"], [1453, 1457, "year_founded"], [1631, 1639, "investor"], [1504, 1512, "investor"], [1521, 1527, "money_funded"], [1517, 1521, "year_founded"], [1695, 1703, "investor"], [1639, 1647, "investor"], [1656, 1662, "money_funded"], [1652, 1656, "year_founded"], [1830, 1838, "investor"], [2427, 2435, "investor"], [2444, 2450, "money_funded"], [2440, 2444, "year_founded"], [2618, 2626, "investor"], [2585, 2593, "investor"], [2602, 2608, "money_funded"], [2598, 2602, "year_founded"], [2776, 2784, "investor"]]}

{"text": "Booker Software Partners with Como to Launch Dedicated Mobile Apps for Every Local Service Business.\n\nLeading Cloud-Based Business Management Platform Partners with Leading Mobile App Platform to Help Businesses Grow With Mobile Booking, CRM, Retention Tools, and More\n\nNEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–June 19, 2014–\n\nBooker, a cloud-based software provider that helps businesses automate their marketing and streamline back-office operations, today announced a partnership with Como, the leading mobile app-creation platform, to provide local service businesses with their own dedicated branded mobile app. The Booker Customer App enables consumers to book appointments with their favorite merchant wherever and whenever they want, right from their mobile phones.\n\nPeople spend almost three hours each day on their mobile device, phone and over 85% of that time is spent in apps1. Now merchants who run Booker can capture some of that valuable mindshare and mobile real estate with a dedicated mobile app.\n\n“With the Booker Customer App merchants get a permanent daily presence on the one thing that never leaves their customers’ sight,” said Matthew Mahoney, vice president business development at Booker. “For consumers, not only will their favorite local service business be more top of mind, it will also be much easier to book appointments with them.”\n\nUnlike directory applications that list merchants alongside competing businesses, the Booker Customer App is specifically dedicated to a merchant’s business. It works across all major device platforms (iOS, Android, and Kindle). The app displays essential information for consumers, such as a map to the merchant’s location and their hours of operation; the ability to ‘click-to-call’; and, most importantly, allows clients to check real-time availability and book appointments directly from the app.\n\n“Como has quickly become the break out leader in building and distributing powerful apps. Their technology dramatically simplifies the creation process, which means together we can create real-time professional booking apps in a matter of seconds,” added Mahoney.\n\nWith the Booker Customer App and its suite of offerings, Booker merchants can now move seamlessly into the mobile space to offer mobile services. In addition, businesses looking to create their own mobile apps themselves can also add Booker’s appointment and scheduling service integration directly through Como’s DIY mobile app-creation platform. These offerings are becoming increasingly critical given the mobile lifestyles of today’s consumers.\n\n“Our partnership with Booker creates a flawless in-app experience; whether a customer wants to schedule a nail-clipping appointment for Fido, or a mani-pedi for themselves, they can do so while on the go,” said Li-at Karpel Gurwicz, VP Marketing at Como. “Consumers are demanding immediate access and intuitive interactions on mobile. Scheduling appointments, visits, and reservations generates loyalty and increased revenues – and our collaboration with Booker is an ideal solution for local service businesses seeking those benefits,” she added.\n\nFor more information on Booker, or to sign up for the company’s services, please visit http://info.booker.com/Booker-Customer-App.\n\nAbout Booker\n\nBooker helps businesses run and grow successfully by streamlining their operations and helping to increase their revenues.

{"text": "India Israel Business Innovation Forum: Israel Invites Indian Startups, Collaborations With Israeli Companies.\n\nAs Part Of The Forum, More Than 10 MOUs Were Signed Between Indian And Israeli Companies\n\nOn the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s six-day visit from January 14 to January 20, the India Israel Business Innovation Forum was also launched today to take the collaboration between the two countries further. The event saw one of the largest business delegations ever from Israel to participate in an event in India.\n\nOver 100 delegates from 74 Israeli companies from various industry sectors such as water, agriculture, foodtech, cybersecurity, homeland security, defense, software, IT and others have joined the forum. Additionally the Israel Innovation Authority is leading a delegation of 20 Israeli startups, in collaboration with Invest India and Startup India.\n\nBarak Granot, Head of the Israeli Economic and Trade Mission in New Delhi said: “We are excited and highly optimistic about India Israel Business Innovation Forum. With a leading economy, a striking concentration of innovative people and countless Israeli tech startup, Israel is the best place for Indian businesses to grow. Ranked at the top of the list of the world’s most innovative capacity and entrepreneurship, Israel’s creative, skilled, and the ambitious workforce is one of the most obvious reasons leading executives to turn to Israel to do business and scout for innovative solutions.”\n\nThe India Israel Business Innovation Forum, therefore, aims to provide technology solutions and business opportunities to Indian startups, corporates, entrepreneurs, and investors. The summit will also witness more than 10 business collaborations/MOUs being forged between Indian and Israeli companies.\n\nKey among these include an MOU between Ashok Leyland and Israeli startup company Phinergy, which is a leading developer of clean energy systems based on metal-air technology; an MOU between the Department of Electronics and IT, Government of Andhra Pradesh and Israel Electric Corporation wherein the Israel Electric Corporation will provide knowledge, services and capacities to the State of Andhra Pradesh in the field of critical infrastructure as well as a collaboration between TechM and ContextSpace Solutions Ltd for a joint cyber solution.\n\nAdditional MOUs will be signed between Reliance Industries and mPrest – a global provider of mission-critical monitoring, control and big data analytics software – for the power utility, industrial IoT, smart cities, critical infrastructure and defense sectors and between Dhampur Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd and clean energy company Ayala Water & Ecology with a scope of $500 Mn.\n\nFurthermore, a collaboration between Best Group and Cortica Ltd has been forged with a focus on security, automotive, Industry 4.0 machines etc.\n\nWhen asked to point out some of the key differences between the Israeli and Indian startup ecosystems, Wendy Singer, Executive Director of Start-Up Nation Central told Inc42, “There is a lot in common in terms of the DNA of Israeli and Indian entrepreneurs. With that, each country brings to the table its strengths and weaknesses. There is no question that Israel has no market. This makes it a high-impact fit because India is looking to create a market for some of its high companies. On the other hand, Israel doesn’t really have huge companies. With the right connectors, Indian companies can look at specific Israeli technologies.”\n\nThe two day event will also see the Prime Ministers of both the countries addressing selectively invited guests. The event will also see panel discussions on agri-innovation, startups, health, tech transfer and venture capital for innovation among others.\n\nWith regards to the sectors that Indian startups are thriving in, Start-Up Nation Central Wendy Singer stated, “Start-Up Nation Central decided at some point that we could not be deeply mapped in every single sector. So, we chose three focus sectors: digital health, agritech and industrial IoT. Within these sectors, we did a deeper mapping to understand what is really happening in terms of innovation.”\n\n“Our approach to India is to apply some of the key Israeli technologies in those sectors to the big challenges in India. Essentially, we want to connect Israeli entrepreneurs with corporates and governments in India that are interested in finding solutions to particular challenges. Our aim is to make the Israeli ecosystem aware of the tremendous opportunities in India and vice versa,” she added.\n\nCommenting on what the summit aims to achieve, Ziva Eger, CEO Invest In Israel stated, “ This summit is only the first phase in getting coordination between the two industries and the two nations. It reflects the potential of our joint venture. When you see the companies from both sides, you see businesses that are hungry to get and give each other business. We have a lot of technology and innovation coming from Israel while we have a great market and companies in India. this summit is only the beginning to getting together on the same road and having a future.”\n\nShe also added that incentives to Indian companies who do real business would include tax rebates, subsidised salaries of employees labor, and a host of tailor made programmes depending on their investment model.\n\nA Quick Look At The Growing Collaboration Between India And Israel\n\nLast year in July, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Israel, among other agreements, the two countries also two countries also launched a bilateral innovation challenge for startups in Israel and India – India Israel Innovation Bridge. PM Modi had launched a five-year technology fund – The Israel India Innovation Initiative Fund, or I4F to grow the business relationship between both countries. Also, both the countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to set up a $40 Mn Industrial Research and Development (R&D) and Technical Innovation Fund.\n\nManaged by the Israel Innovation Authority and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Govt. of India, the programme is jointly managed by Invest India (on behalf of DIPP). The Bridge is a tech platform to facilitate bilateral cooperation between Indian and Israeli startups, tech hubs, corporations and other key innovation ecosystem players.\n\nLater in September 2017, the platform hosted a bilateral innovation challenge for Israeli and Indian startups to combine forces to develop solutions for critical challenges agriculture, water and digital health. In December, 18 teams from various sectors like agriculture, water technology and digital health were chosen as the winners of the India-Israel Innovation Bridge.\n\nThe 18 winners were given the opportunity to take their ideas to the next level with the support of the two governments and an opportunity to participate in ‘the Co-Creation Summit’, which will bring together stakeholders from both startup ecosystems to facilitate collaborations.\n\nWith this further follow up collaboration post the India-Israel Innovation Challenge, the India Israel Business Innovation Forum will open more doors for Indian companies and startups in Israel-which is one of the most fertile startup ecosystems in the world.", "entities": []}
